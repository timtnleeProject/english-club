<p><strong>Dec. 29, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>FLAC</em></strong></p><p>There are many kinds of audio formats in the market, such as MP3, FLAC, WMA, WAV, and APE. Nowadays MP3 is the most popular music format; almost every portable player can run it. In the near future, however, FLAC may replace it to become the first choice of music lovers.</p><p>FLAC, or free lossless audio codec, is a kind of music format. You can compress audio from CD into FLAC without reducing its quality, and you can also burn the FLAC music back to a new CD. The audio quality of the new burned CD is exactly the same as that of the original one. By contrast, in order to reduce the size of the volume, the MP3 format sacrifices the quality of music. It deletes the too high and too low frequency, which can hardly be detected by human ears. You can also copy the MP3 music to a CD, but its quality is inevitably reduced.</p><p>Compared with the MP3 music format, FLAC has several disadvantages. First, the volume of FLAC is far bigger than that of MP3, which means you have to have more space to store it, and the memory is not cheap. Second, not all portable players can encode the FLAC music format, and FLAC players nowadays are so expensive that not everyone can afford to buy it. Even if you have a good FLAC player, that doesnâ€™t mean you are able to listen to music of good quality. You also need to have high quality earphones or good speakers. Unfortunately, high-end speakers cost you an arm and a leg, too. Third, similar to P3, audio data in FLAC format can easily be spread to all over the world via networking. It is difficult to prevent or stop illegal music download.</p><p>Despite its shortcomings, FLAC has many advantages. First, it can provide you with music of high quality if you have a good stereo system. Second, it helps increase capacity for audio data. You can store about 13,000 CDs in one 4TB hard disk, which is smaller than your palm. Imagine how the 13,000 CDs may fully occupy a room. Third, you can efficiently find the audio you want with the computer file system. Fourth, it provides you a strong backup of your CDs.</p><p>Is FLAC really better than MP3? Yes, that is for sure. Although most people cannot tell the difference between MP3 and FLAC, some people say that they can tell them apart if they are used in the same equipment. Human beings tend to pursue innovation and perfection. Along with scientific progress, memory and FLAC players will undoubtedly become cheaper and more commercialized and popular.</p>
