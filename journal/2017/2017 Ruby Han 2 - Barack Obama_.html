<p><strong>June 29, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>Barack Obama</em></strong></p><p>He is an honest man. He said he couldn’t sleep well the first night after they lost the election.</p><p>He is humorous. He told his people he had lost many elections but some people like Vice President Joe Biden had never lost. Joe won both elections, he said, one to the senator, the other to the vice president. </p><p>He is open-minded. He thought a national president was just like one of the relay runners, who need to try their best to run after they take the baton. Although he lost the election, he said he and his team would do their best to make the power transition successful. Because they are American, they are all on the same team. He expressed his gratitude from the bottom of his heart for former President Bush, who made a smooth and wonderful transition eight years ago. Obama is nothing like President Trump, who kept criticizing the previous regime harshly, accusing it of being self-serving and indifferent to people’s hardship in life.</p><p>He is a philosopher of life too. He told his people that life isn’t a straight line—it’s a rugged road. Don’t be disappointed, he said, because of the sometimes failures. He encouraged his team and supporters to stay confident and hopeful, and learn from their mistakes so as to get ready to come back in power.</p><p>I agree with his point. He is a great man. He is Barack Obama.</p>
