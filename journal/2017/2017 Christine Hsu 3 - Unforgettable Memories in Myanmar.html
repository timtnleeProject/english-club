<p><strong>Dec. 22, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>Unforgettable Memories in Myanmar</em></strong></p><p>I could hardly believe that I would go to Southeast Asia again after I had visited Vietnam last July. I expected Yangon, Myanmar would be just as hot as Vietnam, and so I sensed no excitement but only fear of the scorching sun there. I prepared lots of sunscreens but because of the monsoon, they were brought back intact.</p><p>Monsoon was no less a challenge for me than the heat. Right after checking out from the airport, I put on my slippers because I considered it more convenient for me to walk in the rain and visit many pagodas. However, when my Burmese friend drove me to the first pagoda I visited, he recommended that I leave my slippers in his car instead. Looking at the muddy road, I murmured to myself, “How can I possibly step on such dirty ground with my bare feet?” Still, I got no choice but to walk with my toes throughout the visit. Walking without wearing shoes is a new but unpleasant experience. Several times I was extremely worried about falling over the slippery tiled road. </p><p>In the main building, besides a main statue, there were seven smaller Buddha statues, under each of which a stone was sculpted into a different animal. Like the 12 animals for the Chinese zodiac, their seven animals represent the seven days of a week: Tigers for Monday, sheep for Tuesday, elephants for Wednesday, mice for Thursday, guinea pigs for Friday, dragon for Saturday, and Garuda (mythical bird) for Sunday. I was born in the year of the sheep, but in Myanmar, my birthday was on Tuesday, so I worshiped the Buddha with a Tuesday zodiac sign.</p><p>Besides the pagodas tour, taking the circle train left me an unforgettable memory. It took me two hours to go from downtown to the suburbs, but it only cost me NT$5. How cheap it was! Not until I hopped onto the train did I realize why the ticket price was so low. There was no air conditioner but only three fans in each train cabin. Though all the windows were open, it was terribly hot. I had to put my face close to the window to cool myself. As the train went forward, tall buildings rapidly disappeared; I could only see more and more old houses and some of them were surrounded by the flood caused by the heavy rain. The scene inside the train was even worse. Some young people with shabby clothes got on the train with food or vegetables on their heads or their hands. I did not understand what they were shouting or selling but I felt deeply sorry for them carrying such heavy stuff on their shoulders but earning so little money. I suppose that is why I dislike traveling to underdeveloped countries in Southeast Asia. It broke my heart to see so many poor people suffer and yet to be unable to do anything for them.</p><p>Among all the unforgettable memories in Myanmar, visiting Shwedagon Pagoda was the greatest one. At first, its US$8 admission fee made me hesitate to go in since other pagodas were all free of charge. Yet, remembering the saying that no trip to Myanmar was complete without the visit at Shwedagon Pagoda, I decided to go in. Then, it turned out to be an amazingly great surprise.</p><p>After walking 20 minutes from the hotel I stayed at and climbing about 100 stairs with my bare feet, I finally arrived at its gate. Surprisingly, when I passed the entrance station, no one asked me to pay the fee. The person sitting inside the booth just watched me passing by without stopping me. Thus, I got to admire the largest pagoda in Yangon without paying a penny. What an unexpected gift! My friend guessed that it was probably because I had been mistaken for a Burmese. I entered the area at 5 p.m. and did not leave until 7 p.m., which means I had enjoyed both the day and the night views.  Around 6 p.m. professional photographers began to gather at a certain spot to shoot photos of beautiful scenery. Standing beside them, I got to take some splendid pictures too. This was the other gift I got at the Shwedagon Pagoda.</p><p>I am truly grateful that I had a friend to show me around Myanmar, and that the trip brought me delightful surprises and unforgettable memories.</p>
