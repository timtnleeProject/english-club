<p><strong>May 24, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Internet Radio Cancheers</em></strong></p><p>“You should attend the host training class of our online radio, Cancheers.” My boss sent me this message around 10:30 pm two days before that class would start. After a few seconds, I replied to her, “Thanks for giving me this chance and I will learn as much as I can.” That night I could hardly sleep, for I felt excited but frightened at the same time.</p><p>It was not a perfect time for me to attend the training classes on four consecutive Thursdays because on Wednesdays I needed to teach new diagnosis patients a course named The Journey of Breast Cancer. I worried if I could manage both programs well in three working days of a week. What’s more frightening, my boss asked me to integrate The Journey of Breast Cancer into the online radio program. In order to serve cancer patients outside of northern Taiwan, she suggested that I reduce each class of the course into a 15-minute radio program.</p><p>To fulfill this dream, first of all, I had to be trained by the CEO as well as the founder of Cancheers, Ms. Tao, who enjoyed a nation-wide fame as a veteran radio host three decades ago. The online radio Cancheers is on two hours per weekday from 9 pm to 11 pm, replayed the next day from 10 am to 2 pm. Each host, after being trained by Ms. Tao personally, had to produce a program once a week. After about one year, some of the hosts claimed that they could no longer bear the heavy burden of the job. To reduce the hosts’ workload, Ms. Tao organized a second training and recruited more patient volunteers. </p><p>To be honest, I did not think that students, including myself, actually learned from Ms. Tao’s classes how to do an interview or make a program, mainly because we were so used to spoon-fed education. Ms. Tao asked us to learn from others’ mistakes as demonstrated in individual homework. The truth is we did not even know if our self-correction was accurate. Besides preparing the content of our program, we had to use some software to mix music and dialogues or monologues into an mp3 file, but as we had studied about the software for only 50 minutes, we could barely put the basic concept into practice.</p><p>However, to comply with the request of my boss, I finished the training and got permission to host a program. But I’m determined that if she disallows me to finish all jobs during working time but demands me to complete them outside work, I would definitely reject it, no matter how exhilarating I found being a host might be. </p>
