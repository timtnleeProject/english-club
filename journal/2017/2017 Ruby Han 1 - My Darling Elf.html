<p><strong>Mar. 18, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Darling Elf</em></strong></p><p>In the cold morning every Friday, I would run down the stairs, wearing a windbreaker casually, and stand in front of the FamilyMart convenience store to wait for my daughter to come with her little girl, Hui-Hui.</p><p>Reluctant to have to leave her mother, the sulky little girl would insist not to talk to me and even disallow me to touch her. In all seriousness, she would refuse to eat whatever food or drink I prepared for her. The trying time would last half an hour or maybe even longer. I would do my best to please her until she finally ate something so that I could take her to school. About 12 p.m., I would take her home, and for the rest of the day, we would become inseparable. While I was cooking in the kitchen, she would stand behind me and say, “My mom said my brother and I should not use knives.” Before lunch, we would go to the bathroom to wash hands, and she would roll her sleeves and say, “My Mom said I should roll my sleeves when I wash my hands.” What a cute girl!</p><p>After lunch, when I washed the dishes, her grandpa would play house with her. What she liked the best was cooking dinner or baking cakes with paper clay. She asked her grandpa to eat slowly and never to shut his eyes. Although her grandpa did whatever she asked, he ranked only second place in her mind. Seldom did she want him to hold her hands. On the other hand, however, she would follow me wherever I went, even when I took the trash out. Her grandpa pretended to be angry at this and said, “I’ll go outside and leave the two of you alone!” The little rascal said, “Go ahead, but put on a coat!” Once she urged me to go out with her to buy something but rejected her grandpa to go along. Her grandpa teased her by saying, “Your grandma has no money, you know.” She responded, “You could give her some money, couldn’t you?”</p><p>One day, we all went out to the NCCU for dinner. There were many stray dogs chasing after and roaring at each other. She was s0 scared that she jumped on her father immediately, crying, “Bubby, hug me tight, so I won’t be afraid any longer.” How the sweetie pie had melted her father!</p><p>Sometimes it could be very difficult to please the little devil. Before dinner, she would demand her seat without any cushion on it. When she complained about the dust covering it, I cleaned it with a wet rag. Unexpectedly, she said that would wet her pants. I had no choice but to wipe it again, this time with a dry rag. Still, she refused to sit on it because she felt it was sticky. Desperately, I used a fan nearby to dry the chair. Then she said, “It felt ice-cold.” My goodness! I immediately put the cushion back again. When she finally sat down and started eating, it was another story of hard labor.</p><p>Having a strong personality, she always demands her grandpa to play cards or paper clay with her, or even to run after her. Most peculiarly, she would ask me and her grandpa to hold hands while we were talking outside. She would refuse to walk between us, so I was always in the middle with one hand holding the girl’s hand and the other my husband’s. It became embarrassing when she walked in front of the two of us, still hand in hand. I wondered what people might be thinking when they saw this odd scene.</p><p>Whatever the girl does, be it a naïve look or an unexpected act, we are made to be happy and laughing, even more than we will ever be throughout the whole year. We really cherish every minute we spent together with our darling elf.   </p>
