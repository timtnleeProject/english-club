<p><strong>May 22, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>May I Help You?</em></strong></p><p>One day, right after I left my office, I saw a foreign couple checking the MRT map while I was waiting to cross the road. “What a great chance it is to practice my English!” I thought to myself. Then I approached them and asked smilingly, “May I help you?” The wife smiled back and said, “We are wondering how to get to Minquan West Road MRT Station.” In a cheerful tone, I replied, “Just follow me.”</p><p>I took up the rare chance to talk to the two English speakers while the traffic light was still red. Knowing they came from Canberra, Australia, I could not wait to share with them my unforgettable experience of visiting Australia in 1995, 2002 and 2004. It was a long time ago, but I still remembered the lake next to an official building in Canberra, the Sydney Opera House, and the Great Ocean Road in Melbourne. </p><p>They arrived in Taiwan that very morning and were just back from Dihua Street. My curiosity pushed me to ask why they were going to the Mingquan Road Station. Realizing they were going back to the hotel near the 101 Building, I suggested they follow me to the Dongmen Station to transfer to Line 2. I told them that they could take Line 2 to the 101 MRT Station without having to move to another platform. The couple looked carefully at the map to find where the Dongmen Station was and then the husband said to me, “OK. We trust you.” I felt extremely happy since I could get much more time to talk with them.</p><p>Hopping in the cart of Line 2, I continued the chat and found that the husband had a conference to attend while his wife would be free for sightseeing. I recommended her to visit the Four-Four South Village (四四南村) near the 101 MRT Station, which used to be a military community. She could view those old houses and pay a visit to the exhibition to see the furniture used decades ago by soldiers. She was very excited about it since she was fond of historic buildings. Knowing that I worked for a breast cancer alliance, she shared with me a big non-profit breast cancer organization in Canberra, which is a group that I happened to have heard of during my participation in the 16<sup>th</sup> Reach to Recover International Breast Cancer Support Conference. It was great to find a topic we were both interested in. I quickly took out my key ring to show them the pink lady. Not surprisingly, she recognized it and knew that every year on Mother’s Day weekend, thousands of breast cancer patients and their family members joined an activity held by Breast Cancer Network Australia. They all put on pink raincoats and stood in the field of Melbourne Cricket Ground to form an image of the pink lady in support of the one in eight Australian women who would be diagnosed with breast cancer. Though we had just known each other for about 20 minutes, we were able to share our common values: Both of us admired those breast cancer patients’ selflessness and we both supported such a meaningful activity.</p><p>If given the chance, I would like to ask foreigners, “May I help you?” again and again to get free conversations for practicing English. Besides, it is always a blessing to help people who are in need.</p>
