<p><strong>Sep. 21, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>Travelling to Guam</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>	</em></strong>In early September, our family -- my husband, me, and our two daughters -- had travelled to Guam and stayed there for five days. We went snorkeling and swimming, enjoyed beautiful sceneries and delicious food, and visited duty-free shops. </p><p>	In the Guam coast, with its coral reef and not-too-deep sea water, snorkeling is fun: You can see starfish, sea cucumbers and many different kinds of fish. On the fourth day, however, a typhoon came. We could only stay in the hotel all day.</p><p>	Guam is summer all year round. It is twice the size of Taipei and has population of 17,000. There are many tourists every day. It is very suitable for developing tourism. </p>
