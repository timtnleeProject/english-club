<p><strong>June 26, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Blessing in Disguise</em></strong></p><p>One day, the bus left just before I arrived at the station. I felt upset but something interesting drew my attention: A woman told other people waiting at the station about her story of her onion field in southern Taiwan. Surprisingly, whenever the onions could be sold only at an extremely low price, she would give away the onions she grew to her customers for free. At last, she taught us how to cook the onion dishes. I especially appreciated her recipe of Cold Onion: First, you should soak the small pieces of onions in ice water for a while, and then you put chopped parsley coriander, a little salt, and sesame oil on them. Yummy. </p><p>Over half a year ago, one morning, I could not rise up from my bed for no reason, and felt strongly painful. After making tremendous effort, I finally stood up and walked to the dining room with difficulty, but once I sat down, I would feel the aching in the waist again and would feel better only if I stood straight. With fear, I went to the hospital the next morning. Checking the X-ray slide, the doctor told me, “There was no broken bone, no fracture, and no spurs. It was just a little dislocation. Taking medicine may make you feel better, but you will suffer again afterwards.” Just as the doctor said, a month later, I suffered terrible pain again. In addition to seeing the doctor and taking painkillers, I did the rehabilitation at the Minghuan Orthopedics Clinic at Muzha. During this period of treatment, I surprisingly found that for decades I had got used to putting my weight on my left side  for whatever I did such as cooking meals, washing dishes and many other chores. The bad habit of standing with my left foot had increased much burden to my left-side waist. I am very glad the unexpected discovery came to my waist’s rescue. Since then, in order to keep a good balance of my body parts, I have always stood with my two feet evenly or sometimes relied on my right foot a little bit more when I do dishes or other housework. In case I may forget to do it right, I requested my husband to correct my postures whenever necessary. As of today, I have not been afflicted with waist aches and pains again.</p><p>Come to think of it. There is nothing absolutely good or bad in the world. If I hadn’t had a serious car accident six or seven years ago, I wouldn’t have known that besides checking the traffic light while crossing the road, I also need to watch both directions to ensure my safety. If my husband hadn’t got lung cancer, I wouldn’t have known how to choose, cook and even eat food properly. It is indeed, as the idiom goes, “a blessing in disguise.”   </p>
