<p><strong>Mar. 2, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>Surviving a Nightmare</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>	</em></strong>I still could not believe it actually happened: Jogging in the early morning on Jan. 15, I tripped over a stair and had a fractured ankle. As a consequence, my right foot was covered with plaster cast not to be removed until six weeks later. What scared me the most about the unfortunate accident was that I would not be able to go swimming for some time. 	At the first moment of sitting down on a wheelchair, however, I did not think of swimming. I only thought how inconvenient it would be for me to move around since no crutches could be borrowed from the hospital after I checked out. Would I be crawling  or jumping with one leg? I really had no idea what kind of life I would face during the coming two months.</p><p>	 Though I luckily managed to borrow crutches from some friend. greater difficulties were lying ahead for me to deal with. The first difficulty I met was that I could not step over the threshold of the bathroom with crutches. At the end, I jumped in and carefully moved forward with one leg. In the next morning, I surfed the Internet to learn how to use crutches to walk upstairs and downstairs. The second difficulty I suffered was sleeplessness in the very night I was home from the hospital. The nurse only gave a written notification about the plaster cast but did not inform me of any related details, such as the fact that the cast would get harder and harder, or that my leg would be swelling. At midnight , I could hardly raise my right leg to relieve my pain, which together with insomnia had tortured me for over two weeks.</p><p>What I found even more difficult to cope with was that I could go nowhere in the early morning when I should have swum in the pool. When I woke up in the morning or sat at home alone, I could not help but cry badly and helplessly. During the first week, I tried in vain to calm my bad mood. I kept wondering why I was being imprisoned at home. What was the meaning of it?</p><p>Thanks God I eventually got through this nightmare, which was quite similar to what had happened 17 years ago when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt it even worse this time since I could not go out freely. In both situations, however, I got full support from my friends: Volunteers of the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation took turns to accompany me; volunteer co-workers at Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance comforted me via the hotline used to serve breast cancer patients; some friends of mine lent me crutches, a wheelchair and walkers; and the English Club members drove me to join the year-end lunch gathering and kept expressing concern over my situation. Without these faithful and loving friends, my days of broken leg would have been a journey of hell.</p>
