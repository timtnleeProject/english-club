<p><strong>May 4, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>What Type of Funeral Would You Have?</em></strong></p><p>My father-in-law passed away two days after stopping eating. The funeral procedure that followed was so complicated as to make me think how my own funeral should be handled in order to reduce my daughters’ burden.</p><p>My father-in-law did not die of any disease, but simply of aging. Two weeks ago he started to eat less and sleep longer, but still managed to go to the restroom by himself. However, it only lasted for one week. Putting on a diaper, he lay on the bed and no longer talked with us. Two days before he died, my sister-in-law called us to go back because she thought my father-in-law’s situation was severe.</p><p>I hurried back to my parents-in-law’s home right after work. Seeing my husband’s father lying down with his eyes closed tightly and breathing unsteadily, I felt that he might leave us in any second. My sister-in-law thought the same, so she invited the Leader of the Buddha group -- of which she and her family had been members for ages -- to check upon my father-in-law. The Leader looked kind and tender, but little did I expect that he would be in control of the entire funeral, which caused bitter quarrels between my husband and me.</p><p>Following the Leader’s instruction, we took turns to chant Buddha’s name on my father-in-law’s deathbed, and, later after he passed away, continued  chanting for 12 hours . We also accepted the funeral agent he recommended. Furthermore, he decided the funeral date for us and asked us to obey the old tradition--to worship the dead seven times, each on a 7th day. Hearing his proposal, I was shocked and confused since nowadays most people would stop worshiping the dead after the funeral. Usually they did it two to three times, depending on how soon the funeral took place. Besides, he arranged two extra whole-day worship ceremonies -- something I had never heard of. I therefore would not be able to attend lunch gathering with my siblings for Mother’s Day, which really irritated me. I told myself that I should not keep silent but should discuss it with my husband.</p><p>To my great surprise, my husband totally disagreed with me. Our first argument was about the funeral date. The agent gave us seven options but we had to cooperate with the Leader and accept the date he chose. In fact, I had very important training classes to attend on that very day but my husband prohibited me to say a single word. He told me that his sister took the Leader as a very important and helpful Mentor, and therefore we should respect his decision.</p><p>The second quarrel happened after the Leader asked us to be present in the rituals held for the Buddha Bathing Festival in his place on Mother’s Day, and then to chant sutra at a temple for eight hours on another day. He claimed that these two activities could help my father-in-law to leave this world smoothly. I argued with my husband in private that many friends of mine held worshiping ceremonies only before the funeral. Why should we obey the Leader to have so many rituals both before and after the funeral? I did not think my father-in-law would get in trouble on his way to heaven if we neither attended the Buddha-bath ceremony nor chanted sutra at that temple.</p><p>Frustrated and disappointed, I had no choice but to surrender and accept all the arrangements. These troubles reminded me to think about my own future funeral. To prevent my daughters from suffering similar difficulties, I told my elder daughter that after I die, they should call the funeral agent immediately to arrange a funeral as soon as possible. They need not perform any extra worshiping ceremonies either before or after the funeral day. I prefer them to make use of the time to relieve their grief over their bereavement.</p><p>I wonder whether these complicated worshiping rituals for a funeral are commonly practiced nowadays or they are just the Leader’s own idea. Whichever way, as I told my daughters, what children do for their parents while alive is much more important than what they do for their parents after their death. Don’t you agree?</p>
