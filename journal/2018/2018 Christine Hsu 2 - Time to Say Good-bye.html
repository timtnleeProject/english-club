<p><strong>Apr. 27, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>Time to Say Good-bye</em></strong></p><p>As one of its members, I had never thought that the Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance (TBCA) would have to  move out from the office it had been staying at for over 16 years.  The new office is located at the Daan District near Guting MRT Station. Though it is much closer to my home, I did not feel happy about it since the moving was the result of a confrontation between the Chair of the board of directors at TBCA and its former CEO, who was also the landlady of  our old office apartment.</p><p>The conflict began when both of them intended to run for the chair of the board of directors in the past September. The CEO kept telling us that she would replace the chairwoman to become the new head for the future four years. At the time I sensed her strong determination and believed that she would become a great leader by winning full support of board directors since she had made considerable contribution to TBCA and had allowed it to use her apartment as office for free in these 16 years. But things didn't go as she had planned.</p><p>In the year-end board directors’ meeting, the CEO demanded all members to concur with her being the new chair and that no one sing a different tune against her. All the board directors and employees present were shocked by her overbearingness and rudeness. Some members questioned her real motive and wondered if she was doing it only to force the current chair to step down. Naturally, the current chair rejected the CEO’s demand as she intended to complete her term of office.</p><p>Though known for her impulsiveness, surprisingly, the Chair did nothing after the meeting except attending the year-end feasts held by the 40 groups of TBCA members from around Taiwan. She kept quiet until we started to organize the Mar. 17 annual meeting. She asked me to give her the list of all TBCA members and then created a new LINE group, inviting the leaders of the 40 groups to join in. This action infuriated the CEO, who thought the Chair was conspiring against her. But she was completely wrong. As it was discovered later, people in the LINE group only greeted each other without ever discussing the election. However, the CEO chose not to believe it and acted irrationally. She quit the position of CEO and even refused to attend the annual meeting. A rumor spread out that we had to move out once the CEO lost the election. Though no one wanted it to happen, two days after the election, the terrible rumor came true. The former CEO, the landlady, refused to talk with the Chair and broke off any possible negotiation.</p><p>It was really sad  to witness such a rupture between the former CEO and TBCA. Her extreme reaction to her loss in the election both puzzled and disappointed me. There is, however, little I can do. I can only accept the result and hope that everything at TBCA will go well after moving to the new office.</p>
