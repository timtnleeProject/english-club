<p><strong>Dec. 20, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>Terrible Amnesia</em></strong></p><p>	</p><p><a id="_gjdgxs"></a>The older I am, the more forgetful I become.</p><p><a id="_crsj28f2tnrv"></a></p><p>Last year, after having lunch with friends who gathered for the Taipei First Senior Girls’ High School anniversary, I left earlier than everyone else and forgot my cell phone on the table. Fortunately, one of my friends found the phone and delivered it in person to my home. Yesterday, we gathered together again for similar celebration. During the lunch, they couldn’t help joking about the cell phone incident. How embarrassing it was!</p><p>Such incidents, however, are not incidental, minor problems in my current life. One day, I went to the library and then bought food for cooking as a daily routine. After returning home from the market, I couldn’t find my cell phone though I had looked everywhere. I searched my memory real hard and then finally judged that the library was the most likely place where I lost my phone because I was very certain I had not used the phone during the time between leaving the library and arriving home. My husband reminded me that I needed to report to the police to suspend the phone service and to ask them to help me find the phone.</p><p>The next morning, right after I stepped into the library, quite unexpectedly, I saw the policeman who helped me investigate the case. He told me there was not a clue yet though he had made all possible efforts to find my phone, and that all we should do now was to wait.</p><p>Another day passed. When I took out some vegetable from a plastic bag from the fridge, I could not believe my eyes: My cell phone was lying in the bag all along, safe and sound! Now it all came clear to me: On the day I bought the vegetables in the market, I conveniently put the cell phone in the bag, and after I returned home I forgot all about my phone and put the whole bag into the refrigerator. I panicked when I couldn’t find my phone, and the bag in the fridge was the only place I didn’t look. Worst of all, I went to bother the policeman. Terrible senile dementia!</p><p>Ashamedly, I went to the Muzha police office to withdraw the claim immediately. To show my appreciation for what the policeman had done for me, I sent two thank-you cards separately to the policeman in charge and his supervisor, the police chief. A few days later, the police chief wrote me back to tell me that the policeman in charge of my case had been rewarded for his dedication to duties. What a luckily happy ending!</p><p>Senile dementia has annoyed me for a long time. I can’t find my purse before paying for things I have bought, and I can’t find my keys before entering my apartment, which always makes me nervous. To avoid such moments of embarrassment, I always put NT$100 in all of my purses and even in the cell phone case; I string the door keys across the handbag; and I get a strap cord to hold each pair of my glasses. </p><p>Still, plans always fall behind changes. As the printer at home is out of function, I saved my journals in a USB and had them printed out in the library. The next day, one of the librarians who had helped me print out my journals asked me about the color of my USB and then gave it back to me. My goodness! She returned me my USB even before I realized I had lost it. Poor me! What should I do with my amnesia?</p><p>	</p>
