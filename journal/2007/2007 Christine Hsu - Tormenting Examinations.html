<p><strong>Oct. 5, 2007</strong></p><p><strong><em>Tormenting Examinations</em></strong></p><p>Since finishing the treatment of breast cancer six years ago, I have taken regular checks for my abdomen and breast. Every time it turned out fine, except last June when the doctor found a 1.4 cm mass in my liver. </p><p>I got a further check by Computer Tomography(CT) and the result remained the same, but my surgeon still could not confirm what it was. He suggested I either have further check three months later or have my liver punctured immediately. Despite my little knowledge of liver puncture, I chose the latter. The doctor told me the puncture might cause a big wound in my liver or make my liver bleed massively. There was no time for regret as I was already in the operation room. What I felt insufferable was that I would have to lie in bed over eight hours to stop my liver bleeding. Thank God the doctor could not find the mass after carefully scanning my liver for about 10 minutes. Though it ended up with a false alarm after wasting one day at the hospital, I felt lucky that I needed to go through examinations and unexpected side-effects. An even better luck followed one month later, when I got a great compensation by gaining payment from the insurance company, which was more than my annual premium. </p><p>Obeying my surgeonâ€™s advice, I took another CT check this week. I really disliked it because I had to drink up to a 1,000cc dope before the CT scan. It tasted like plastics. Without sugar, I could never have swallowed any drop of it. Moreover, the injection during the checking procedure tortured me terribly. When the medicine flowed in my blood vessel, my throat felt hot and dry. The burning blood was flowing through my whole body. After the terrible process, I suffered the side-effects such as measles and dizzy feeling, which were even more unbearable.</p><p>Now, I do not need liver puncture again, but just have the follow-up by supersonic check six months later.</p>
