<p><strong>Oct. 7. 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>At Forty</em></strong></p><p><em>        </em></p><p>"Judy, we are 40 already. We couldn't earn much more by going forward, and also we couldn't save any loss from going backward. We must keep what we have only, you know?" my best friend told me. I know. Recently I have been thinking seriously about my being 40. My children have grown up and gone to school, and my husband has changed from being lovely to being hateful. And now I am 40.</p><p>I attend some classes to kill time. It is difficult to find new friends at 40, and old friends are busy all the time, not to mention those I've lost contact with, and yet, friends seem all the more important to a 40-year-old.</p><p>One's health is getting worse at 40. I have headaches and lumbagos often, easily get fat, and always forget what I need to do. I almost could not remember any new information. It is difficult to understand the meaning of modern science and technology.</p><p>"Judy, I made a plan to retire after two years."</p><p>"I can't believe it. Why? How can you do that? You retire at 40!"</p><p>It's impossible for me. I am supposed to work 10 more years. If I retire now, how can I afford my children's living expenses, their school tuition and my old age pension?</p><p>Of course I really envy people who only enjoy their life and don't need to work for money, early at their 40 years of age.</p>
