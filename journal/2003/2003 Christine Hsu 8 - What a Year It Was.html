<p><strong>Dec. 26, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>What a Year It Was</em></strong></p><p>What a year it was! It was an unforgettable year because of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Everyone must remember those terrible months during which time we all wore masks and had to check the temperature when we got into the hospital or public buildings. People had kept praying that SARS would never come back.</p><p>This Monday I got a good indication from my doctor that the result for the regular medical test was fine, which means I had already passed the most dangerous period. From now on, I only need to take the medical examination every season instead of every three months. My doctor wondered why I was happy to work as a volunteer at the hospital every week but felt reluctant to take the test every three months. The reason was simple: being a volunteer worker was much better than being a patient.</p><p>A few days ago I watched the movie "Forrest Gump" on TV, a film that touched me deeply every time I saw it. Mr. Gump said, "You have to put the past behind you before you move on." Before I put the year 2003 behind I would like to record down some good memories.</p><p>The same day a year ago, I just sent Christmas cards to all our customers. My boss blamed me so harshly for inappropriately putting customers' addresses on the envelopes that I was almost brought into tears. When I cleaned the office before the lunar Chinese New Year I never thought that I would quit in April. I did not get much free time after I resigned. Some members of those groups I had joined asked me to go back. I only chose to keep attending English class because I need much more time for Tzu-chi and NCF Foundation.</p><p>I should have attended the training course for being Tzu-Chi's volunteer worker last year if I had not taken chemotherapy. At the end of this year I will be a formal commissioner, which is the greatest honor for a Tzu-Chi volunteer worker. For me the title means greater responsibilities, and more troubles, too. I have to spend a lot of money to prepare uniforms and a golden brooch.</p><p>The other happy thing about this year was that the self-help group of NCF Foundation, which I established in 1999, had just finished the 19th activity a couple of weeks ago. We will celebrate our 5th anniversary in the coming June. Since 1999 we have been holding four activities each year, even during the SARS period. We are quite proud of ourselves. Next year we decided to form a sign-language group for parents and children, not only for studying sign-language songs but also for performing in any activity of the NCF Foundation. It is a new challenge for me to be their sign-language teacher.</p><p>The most fun job I got this year was as an English volunteer worker of Taipei City Library. During the summer vacation I was able to attend both basic and advanced training classes. Last month I had a two-hour practical training course at the Wen-Shen library. Now I am waiting for further assignments. These training courses aroused my interest in English storytelling. I began to read English stories for my younger daughter's classmates in September. After one month I went to my elder daughter's class every Thursday to read an English story until now. I found most of the books were very interesting and were suitable for my kids. My daughters started to read, too. I found I had gained something much more valuable than money, as I always did when doing volunteer work.</p><p>Of all places around the world it is Melbourne that I love most. It was the first place I traveled by myself and my friends there were hospitable. After I came back from there this August, I began to contact Tzu-Chi volunteers in Melbourne. It was not difficult for me to talk to them after visiting them two times. We could share not only our volunteer work experiences but also almost anything about Melbourne.</p><p>Besides reading English stories at school, I also taught two classes of sign-language songs. For the performance to be given at the end of this semester, we are planning to invite some other classes and the principal to be our audience. Meanwhile we will record the show by digital camera so that every student can have a VCD for memory.</p><p>As Mr. Gump's mother said in the movie, "Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get." I do not know what my year 2004 will be like. I wish to have enough time to fulfill all my responsibilities.</p>
