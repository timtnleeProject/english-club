<p><strong>Oct 17, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Road Home</em></strong></p><p>This movie's director is Zhang Yi-Mou and it talks about a schoolteacher and his wife. The schoolteacher came to a village called Sanlitun in China when he was 20 years old. He went there to teach and then he met the lady Di, who fell for him at the first sight and became his wife after a few years. They were the first couple married for love in that village. The movie showed how a Chinese love story was different from an American romance: The latter tends to be passionate and erotic, while the former seems more serene and tender.</p><p>In the village, everyone had stopped taking the water from the old well since they had a new one. Di still went to the old well so that she could pass by the school every day and listen to the teacher's reading. She thought his voice was the best in the world and she had already listened to it over 40 years, but it was still not enough for her. Once when she was taking water, she saw the teacher come up to the well so she poured water back to the well just to stay there longer. But other people around her never did have a chance to be alone with the teacher. Every time when the teacher went back to the city, Di would wait on the road to school on the day he would come back even if it was snowing heavily. When the teacher passed away, Di, who later became his wife, insisted on following the old tradition, having people carry the dead and call his name on the road home so that the dead would remember this way home. As all young men had moved to the city to work, the mayor could not find enough people to do it. The teacher's son decided to hire people from nearby villages. Eventually, hundreds of the teacher's students came back to do it when they heard the news.</p><p>To rebuild the old school was the schoolteacher's life goal and his wife also donated all her money to help fulfill this dream. The teacher hoped his son could be a teacher but his son chose to be a businessman. After the funeral, the schoolteacher's son asked the mayor to congregate all the kids to the old school. His mother had said if he could teach for one day, his father would be very happy. He used his father's book at the first teaching. When his mother heard the familiar reading voice, she walked out from her house speedily. She had tears in her eyes when she saw her son teaching.</p><p>It was very sad that the schoolteacher could not see his son teaching before he died. But how fortunate he was to have such a nice and sweet wife in his life. I like this movie because of the true love of this couple. Di, especially, was so brave to show her love to the teacher in such a conservative society. She knew what she wanted and she pursued it without hesitation. This was not easy even for a woman living in the 21st century.</p>
