<p><strong>Sep. 22, 2003  </strong></p><p><strong><em>My Dream House</em></strong></p><p>The important elements of my dream house are as follows:</p><ol><li>Good neighborhood: It's better to have many cultivated and friendly neighbors with educational backgrounds similar to mine. We can communicate smoothly and even have a good chat some time together. </li><li>Convenient transportation facilities: It's convenient to go from my house to the schools, the post office, the hospital, the market and the restaurants. Of course, it'd be better if it is near the MRT or at least next to the bus station. I don't have to drive and worry about parking.</li><li>A beautiful garden around the house: A beautiful garden with a comfortable coffee table and chairs. Certainly, beautiful flowers, soft green grass and some big trees are a must. I can read novels or newspapers, or even write my journals in my garden in the mornings or evenings.</li><li>Simple but delicate style: I prefer light colors to make the house seem brighter. A delicate design is necessary to show my extraordinary taste.</li><li>An elevator: Unless I am living downstairs, I'd prefer a building with an elevator because climbing stairs is hard work for me. I don't like to abuse my poor legs.</li><li>Some sports equipment: I especially like the treadmill. When I stand up on it, I'll be chest up, chin up and back straight and I'll walk at a fast pace but with a regular rhythm. After a while, I will be feeling like I'm walking toward a bright future. I like this feeling very much.</li><li>A good view: I could see far away from my house. I especially like to see the light from millions of street lamps far away at night. It's such a beautiful and magnificent sight.</li><li>Fresh air: Maybe Mu-Cha is a good choice?</li></ol><p>Perhaps you'll say it's impossible to have a garden, fresh air, an elevator and all the conveniences all at the same time. As a matter of fact, if you look harder, you'll find a lot of buildings that combine a library, a simplified gymnasium, a small garden, and many others. Hopefully, it won't cost too much, so that we can all afford it.</p>
