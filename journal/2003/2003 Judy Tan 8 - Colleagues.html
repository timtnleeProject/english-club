<p><strong>Dec. 4. 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Colleagues </em></strong></p><p>It is said that your colleagues are just like cats, always silent but ready to use their claws to scratch you from behind. Some of them are just like foxes, shrewd and crafty, and some just like pigs, very lazy and too eager to be successful for seeing only the immediate advantages. Of course your company is just like the zoo. There are so many strange colleagues around you.</p><p>One minute your colleagues are quarreling with each other fiercely, but next minute they'll be hugging each other. Aren't they crazy? Can your colleagues become your good friends? It is really difficult. You can never imagine what kind of tough problems your colleagues, like animals, will cause you.</p><p>We always get heavy pressure at our job. The pressure ordinarily comes from our colleagues, rather than from the job. It is a very strange culture at the job: everybody holds his ground to hope for promotion and does not hesitate to do anything just to win their superiors' favor. It is a cruel competition, isn't it? But I'd say you'll probably be bored to death without your dear colleagues.</p>
