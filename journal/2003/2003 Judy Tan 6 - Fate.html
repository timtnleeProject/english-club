<p><strong>Sep. 5, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Fate</em></strong></p><p>What is fate? Do you believe in it? Can we change our fate? There are so many questions about fate. Everybody hopes for a good fate in his lifetime. It is said that a good fate is more than a beautiful face.</p><p>A colleague of mine, Huey, although divorced, must be in charge of her son's living expenses, or her ex-husband will stop them from meeting each other. She worked hard day and night until her health condition worsened seriously. We all blame her ex-husband while she still thought him not a bad man. We advise her to find another man to marry to, but she always thinks her fate is too bad to have her situation changed a little bit. No matter what we say, it seems useless. In other words, she gave up on herself.</p><p>Does fate depend on us ourselves or on God? Teachers at school always told us that if we worked hard, we would get a better fate. But we also know it is uncertain in terms of fortune. Huey has been working hard and is always kind. What is the problem then?</p>
