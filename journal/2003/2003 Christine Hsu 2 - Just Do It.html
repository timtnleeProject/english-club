<p><strong>May 09, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Just Do It</em></strong></p><p>I never thought I would be a full-time mother again. I remembered when I found a new job last year, I told myself, "Whatever difficulties I may meet, I will never stop working."</p><p>In the beginning I was really happy to have a place to stay in the daytime instead of sitting in front of the computer to chat with friends. But after a few months I felt I lost many things. I couldn't work as a volunteer in the hospital and couldn't maintain those websites for volunteer workers and my living community. I had to refuse all volunteer work just because of my job and I didn't really learn much from it. One day, I went to the hospital for a general examination. I saw many volunteers working in the lobby and I suddenly felt it was my real stage. I went to work because I wanted to earn money but the income for me was only a number in the bank account. I decided to quit my job.</p><p>This time was very different from last time because I quitted for myself, not for my children. But because of SARS I couldn't go back to the hospital so I had plenty of time to stay at home. I began to think about how to make my house look better so I tried to clean it. After a few days, everywhere looked good and my daughters felt the difference, too. I also prepared desserts for kids when they came back from school. They told their classmates about the desserts and one of their classmates asked her mother to do the same.</p><p>It was impossible for me to imagine that one day I couldn't go to the hospital to be one of the volunteers, but it really happened. All hospitals asked their volunteers to go back home. The Zen-Yen master had said, "There are things in life that cannot wait: fulfilling filial piety and doing good deeds." Now I could totally realize its real meaning. Just do it or we will miss the chance.</p><p>I heard from the news that a pregnant woman who was a nurse in Jen-Chi hospital just passed away last night. Her husband insisted on seeing her the last time regardless of another 14 days' quarantine, but the hospital refused his request. It was hard to imagine how he endured the anguish for losing his wife and the unborn child at the same time. We can't help but pray that SARS will leave us soon.</p>
