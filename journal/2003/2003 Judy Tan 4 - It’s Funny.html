<p><strong>May 16, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Itâ€™s Funny</em></strong></p><p>It was about 6:25 a.m. in the morning. I woke up my husband and prepared simple food for him to go to the office. After he went out, I started to wash the clothes by hand as usual. After I finished my washing, I went to my bedroom and watched the clock. It was 5:50 a.m. I  found I had made a big mistake. My husband went out too early.</p><p>I tried to phone him about it, but I got no answer. About two minutes later, my husband came back home. He said, "I was wondering why there were no students at all at the bus stop. I looked at my wrist watch and found the mistake." He blamed me and went to sleep again.</p><p>I felt sorry for him and found the situation very funny.</p>
