<p><strong>May 2, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Two Persons and a School</em></strong></p><p>I recently watched a TV program based on a real story which happened at the Maya farm in the Mazhai village of Changheng county, HeNan Province. Here, people called the Yellow River shoal, a place where even the Yellow River didn't want to turn back. It talked about a handicapped man, teacher Ma, who, despite his disability, insisted on establishing a school for poor children.</p><p>When teacher Ma was 16 years old he was diagnosed with muscle innutrition symptoms and he was told that he would not live past the age of 20. He didn't know what he would be able to achieve with his remaining 4 years. Fortunately he had a very intelligent father, who told him, "A person's fate is like the top of a dam. As you are destined to be the top of a dam, you have to be strong enough to stand against the flood. My dear son, is the Yellow River straight? No. As you know, there are 99 curves. Life is the same. We can't stop just because the road is not straight."</p><p>After teaching as a temporary full-time in an elementary school for one year, teacher Ma decided to establish a school for those children whose parents couldn't afford the tuition. Teacher Ma's family spent a year building a classroom, but no one came to study even though they only charged a small registration fee and it was all free for those who couldn't afford it. Teacher Ma finally decided to invite those children in person. He couldn't walk so he moved himself by moving a small stool on which he sat. One afternoon, teacher Ma was confronted by heavy rain on the way to his neighbor's house. The road become slippery after raining and teacher Ma fell down again and again. Finally he stopped and looked into the sky without a word. When his father and younger sister found him, they held each other and cried badly. Teacher Ma got a serious fever for some days, but as soon as he was recovered he kept going.</p><p>At that time, teacher Gu, who then lived in HuNan province and later became teacher Ma's wife, read from a pen pal advertisement in a magazine that a handicapped teacher had established a school and hoped to find friends to share his dream. She felt it was incredible and decided to write a letter to find out if it was true. After that, they began to write letters to encourage each other for about one year. By this time teacher Ma already had 37 students but his health grew worse day by day. Two of his students wrote a letter to teacher Gu to invite her to help teacher Ma.</p><p>Feeling inferior due to his physical disability, teacher Ma didn't meet teacher Gu when she arrived at his home until dinner time. Teacher Gu couldn't understand why he showed up so late and she didn't know about teacher Ma's real situation until she saw him coming across the room by moving his small stool. She said in tears, "I didn't know your life was so difficult."</p><p>Among teacher Ma's family, his mother and elder brother also had the same disease. His father had to support the whole family with his meager salary so they were very poor, but teacher Gu finally decided to give up her wealthy life in HuNan and help Mr. Ma to fulfill his dream. She became his wife. In the next 15 years, she not only had to take care of teacher Ma but also had to look after the whole family and their small school. She saved every dollar to build another two classrooms for more students. People asked her why she didn't feel the pain in living such a poor life. She said pain and happiness were two ends of the same scale so how much happiness you wanted determined how much pain you had to take.</p><p>Their story was reported on TV and newspapers so finally they got the Tzu-Chi Foundation's help to build a school for them and all those kids. Now teacher Ma is about 37 years old but he is still alive and keeps fulfilling his dream to be a good teacher.</p><p>What a touching and beautiful love story! How many people can get such true and unselfish love? When they got married, teacher Ma wrote a poem to his wife. </p><p><em>We are two boats in the vast ocean.</em></p><p><em>Today we meet at this port casually and </em></p><p><em>you throw your anchor to my boat.</em></p><p><em>We will sail to the ocean together.</em></p><p><em>	Because I have you, I have happiness forever. </em></p><p>I can't remember how many tears I have shed for them after I knew how hard they had worked for those children. They can only afford a very basic life, but still they help people without hesitation.</p><p>I decided to write down this story in English to share it with my foreign friends. I know my words can hardly give a complete picture of their touching story, but I hope my friends can feel and learn their spirit of selflessness after reading it.</p>
