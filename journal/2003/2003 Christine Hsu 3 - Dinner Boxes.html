<p><strong>May 23, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Dinner Boxes</em></strong></p><p>Since Mayor Ma decided to move some people quarantined in Ho-Pin hospital to Gi-Ho government building, Tzu-chi volunteers began to prepare meal boxes for all of them. At the beginning they had to prepare 300 meal boxes for lunch and dinner every day. This Monday I went to attend this activity but only had to prepare about 80 dinner boxes. Most of the patients went back home last Sunday. Besides the delicious food we also wrote a card to bless and encourage them.</p><p>It was the first time I joined this kind of activity. There were about 20 volunteers working together. Firstly we had to wash about 200 boxes and the vegetables for this meal. In the meal boxes there were fried noodles, which were in a nice yellowish color and tasted yummy, 2 pieces of nice firm rolled sui-shi and a golden spring roll.  Before we began to work we together prayed for the SARS to leave us soon. The ceremony also included reading part of the letter written by Chen-Yen Master and singing a praying song.</p><p>The main chef was a professional cook so he knew how to prepare a nice meal very well. I had no idea how much vegetable and rice would be enough for 80 people. No one assigned jobs to us, but everyone found things to do automatically. They said it was the Tzu-chi spirit. No one in this group complained about too many things to do but only worried about having nothing to do. I learned how to make Su-Shi from those sisters and the next day I served it as desserts for my daughters. They were very happy and enjoyed the desserts very much. I was grateful to get this extra benefit.</p><p>Most of the volunteers not only helped to prepare dishes but also donated money for those vegetables and rice.  How could their hearts be so big? </p><p>On Wednesday I went to teach some volunteers of NCF Foundation sign language because we would have a performance next Tuesday for a donation ceremony. I was so happy to have the opportunity to do something for the foundation. After we finished the practice, one of our volunteers suggested to me that the foundation should pay us a traffic fee since the foundation's volunteers were paid for their regular meeting. This volunteer was a very nice person and had been doing many things for the foundation, but I thought if she could forget about traffic fees and what she had done for the foundation, this volunteer job would be more meaningful.</p>
