<p><strong>Sep. 12, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Le-Sheng Home</em></strong></p><p>This was the third time I went to Le-Sheng Nursing Home with Tzu-Chi volunteer workers. It was our monthly training course for September. After visiting it we went to Tzu-Chi Hospital in Hsintien City.</p><p>Three leprosy patients shared their stories with us. All of their fingers were curved because of the virus. The first patient, a 70-year-old, told us that a long time ago he always turned his back when he saw strangers but now he would share his story with others to remind people how fortunate they were so they could do more good deeds than he did. Someone asked him, "Why could you be so happy?" He said he was content with what he owned so he lived happily. He not only talked about himself but also played the electric piano for us. What a difficult thing it was for him, but he made it.</p><p>The second patient, Mr. Chin, was the leader of Le-Sheng Nursing Home. He was a general when he got the disease. Because of leprosy he had to be quarantined and leave his glorious army life. Mr. Chin told the news about the 6 ladies from China who were thrown into the sea and drowned in Miaoli County. According to him, those ladies had to pay NT$100,000 to come to Taiwan. The sum was big enough to cover their two years' life expenses in Mainland China, but why did they still want to come here? They desired to earn much more money, however, destroyed their lives and broke at least six families. Mr. Chin asked us, "What is the Tzu-chi spirit?" and then replied to himself, "Helping people with love." It sounds simple, but is not easy to achieve in reality.</p><p>The last patient to talk, Lin Yeh, was a female and she came here when she was 16 years old. At the beginning she blamed her father and cried all the time. One of her neighbors told her a boy's story. When this boy was nine, he got leprosy so all his neighbors asked his father to send him away. His father put this boy on a small boat and dragged the boat to the sea. When he wanted to cut the rope, his son begged and said, "Father, I will have only one meal every day. Don't cut the rope." But his father still wanted to do it, so his son kept begging, "Father, I will have only one meal for every two days. Don't cut the rope." His father had no choice but to cut the rope. After that his father went insane and told everyone he had killed his son. How sad! I couldn't stop my tears. I remembered the news about a father who committed suicide yesterday because of his liver cancer, after killing his own three kids. Who could stop this kind of tragedy and when? The boy's story changed Lin Yeh's thoughts and she did not complain about her father again. She told us if not for leprosy she would not have been able to lead such an extraordinary life by becoming one of the Tzu-Chi members, sharing her life with people all over the world.</p><p>These three patients each had a very simple belief and kind heart. They are grateful for what the Tzu-chi Foundation had done for them and they not only donated money but also spent time sharing stories with us. No wonder Master Cheng Yen said, "Le-Sheng Nursing Home is like heaven in this world."</p>
