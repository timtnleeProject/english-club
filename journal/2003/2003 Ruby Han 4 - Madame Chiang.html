<p><strong>Nov. 3, 2003  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Madame Chiang</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>I don't know why I had been regarding Madam Chiang just as a flower vase, a decoration, for a long time. I always thought she was nothing but a pretty face, a graceful figure and an eloquent speaker. Not until I finished reading a book about Madame Chiang have I changed my opinion of her.</p><p>Like father, like daughter. Her father was a smart, hard-working, brave, patriotic and successful businessman, giving all his children a good education, both Chinese and American. After she got married, Madam devoted herself to her husband and her country. When President Chiang was abducted in Xi-An, she was against those who insisted to rescue the hostage and solve the problem with force. She did not want to cause another civil war, which may reduce China's power in fighting against the enemy, the Japanese Imperial Army. She tried to communicate and negotiate with Chang Xue-liang through many different ways and then flew to Xi-An, successfully rescuing her husband.</p><p>When the war against the Japanese invasion started in Shang-Hai in 1937, Madame Chiang established the women's alliance quickly to raise funds, make clothes, and do many other things to fulfill the needs of the soldiers. She went to the battlefront and hospitals to encourage the soldiers and to realize what they wanted every day. Once she went to the battlefront again. When a Japanese air fighter was throwing bombs, she got seriously injured with several bones broken. She was a brave first lady who has won the respect of her own people and all around the world.</p><p>In 1942, she went to the US to receive treatment of her old wound. There and then she persuaded the American to help us defend our country from the Japanese. It was a glorious day. Madam was invited to stand at the Congress to give a speech to the Americans. She won the hearts of all Americans with her smart personality, her persuasive speech and her gorgeous appearance. The Chicago Mayor gave her a city key.  L.A. Mayor also declared it to be a "Madam Chiang's Day" when she arrived at L.A. Everywhere she went she won an unprecedented welcome, respect and honor. She returned home with a lot of money and blessing from the American people, bringing the country victory against the Japanese.</p><p>Undoubtedly she had many drawbacks. It is said that she was leading an extravagant life and had a very bad temper. But all her life she devoted herself to our country as much as she can and had all of the world help our country. So, I admire her great achievement.</p>
