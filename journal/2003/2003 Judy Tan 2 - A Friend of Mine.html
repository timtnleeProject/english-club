<p><strong>Apr. 18, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Friend of Mine</em></strong></p><p>Joy was a classmate of my tourist sales class in the occupation training center about 20 years ago. Her character is like her name, full of joy. She always brought joy to our class.</p><p>Once, she invited us to her home. Her rich father had many houses around Pate Road. But, she fell in love with a soldier that was not rich. Her father did not allow her to marry him. It was said that her father later sent to the U.S. to prevent them from seeing each other. Later Joy came back for her lover. When they got married, Joy’s father did not attend their wedding. I thought her father forgave her after she gave birth to a baby. Now, she has three children and her husband loves her very much.</p><p>Recently she has been seriously sick. Her immune system is seriously damaged. She got diabetes and the disease affected her eyes. She couldn’t see clearly and she had to have an operation for her eyes. I’m very worried about her health.</p><p>What a pity that she owns the whole world but loses her health.</p>
