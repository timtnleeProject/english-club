<p><strong>Sep. 5, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Morning Activities</em></strong></p><p>Last Monday at the conference for parents and teachers, I tried to persuade some parents of my younger daughter's classmates to read English stories for our kids every Monday and Thursday instead of hiring a teacher from outside the school to teach them English during the two mornings. I found out that one of our parents taught English at this school, and she has decided to prepare course plans for us. Eventually, four mothers agreed to give it a try.</p><p>This Monday morning I did not know I had to go to school. The other three mothers did not prepare for it either, so they simply let those kids watch a VCD about English alphabets. Most students fell asleep. These mothers felt frustrated and lost their confidence. One of them was the parents' representative of our class and she decided to ask all parents again about the idea of hiring an English teacher. When I knew about it, I tried hard to dissuade her from it and asked her to summon the other two mothers to talk about it this morning.</p><p>These mothers were enthusiastic enough, but lacked self-confidence. They were afraid their pronunciation was not good enough and that they were able to come up with good course plans for our kids. I took them to the school library and showed them some books this morning. The parents' representative still insisted: "If we could employ a good teacher, why would we want to do it by ourselves?" And she thought we might spend a lot of time and yet never get the result we expected.</p><p>My husband told me if no one wanted to do this job then I should not persist. I have thought about it for two days and I have only one idea in my mind: "I must try it.  I really feel like doing something for my daughter and her classmates. I know my daughter is very happy seeing me doing this all for her." It was a big challenge and the parents' representative might still think we would never be as good as a professional English teacher, but at least one of the mothers supported it by saying, "We should make every effort to do it and if it does not work, we can still employ a teacher." Her words did encourage me much and that kind of determination is exactly what we need now.</p>
