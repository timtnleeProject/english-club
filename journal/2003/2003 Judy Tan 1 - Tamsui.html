<p><strong>Mar. 13, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Tamsui</em></strong></p><p>My friends asked me to go to Tamsui together. It took us about 50 minutes from Muhjah to Tamsui by MRT. Fish-ball soup and Ah-guei are both famous foods in Tamsui. Ah-guei is a dumpling filled with bean flour noodles. It is very special and delicious.</p><p>Fisherman Harbor is a new scenic spot in Tamsui. So we took the bus to go there. We drank coffee in the coffee shop by the sea. The sea was so clear and boundless. The sun shone upon the water, twinkling like the stars. There were many boats on the sea. A maneuver was taking place. A visitor told us that the maneuver was held once every month.</p><p>Around 5:00 p.m. Tamsui changed from quiet to noisy because many students flooded the beautiful town after school.</p><p>Before we left, we went to buy some fish-crisp, which is also one of the famous local products. Idling around Tamsui town is such a pleasure.</p><p>	</p>
