<p><strong>Sept. 25, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>If</em></strong></p><p>My mom always sighs and says that if she had been able to take care of my two daughters for me, I would never have given up my job, and that if I were still at work, I might become an outstanding career woman. But I think, in fact, I would have missed more than gained if I hadn’t quit my job: I would not have fully participated in every small part of my daughters’ growth; I could not have enjoyed the great happiness in the time spent with them; and we might not have established such a close and solid relationship among us. All of these are exactly what I treasure the most. So, I’ve always been gratified by the decision I made at that time. No regret. Only gratification.</p>
