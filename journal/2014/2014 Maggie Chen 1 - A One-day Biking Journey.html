<p><strong>January 20, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>A One-day Biking Journey</em></strong></p><p>My husband and I, both fond of hiking, moved 18 years ago to Muzha, an area with many intertwining footpaths and bike paths as well as a lot of bamboo forests. We often ride through those paths to enjoy the fragrance exuded from fresh bamboo shoots. </p><p>   </p><p>Five years ago, an 80-milometer-long path was built along the river stretching from Muzha to Tamsui. It has become our regular routine to enjoy a 7-hour biking on this path. We always stop on our way to visit some natural and cultural waterfront sceneries along the river such as Fushe Riverside Park, Youth Park, Green Lake Scenic, and Dihua Historic Street. </p><p>   </p><p>On the weekends, we like to stop at Muchangding Memorial Park to watch various animal-shaped kites in the sky. At Wild Goose Park and Guandu Nature Park, through the telescope you can look for various waterfowls wandering around on the wetlands. Reading the instructions on the board and hearing birdwatchers’ explanations help you learn more about their habits and habitats. A short stay at a café halfway of the journey for a cup of coffee or dessert would fill us with needed energy before we take the ferry across Tamsui River to the other bank for gourmet snacks. At dusk, we would lean against the rail on Fisherman Wharf to admire the beauty of sunset, intoxicated in the playing and singing of street artists. As the night falls, we would appreciate the flickering lights on both sides of the bank, which fully displays the romantic charm of Taipei.</p><p>   </p><p>Besides the bike paths in Muzha, there are many others in Taipei City and County. If you like, you can surf trail maps online and have a pleasant and colorful biking day as we do.</p>
