<p><strong>Oct. 31, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Wish to Be a Historian</em></strong></p><p>I love history. My fascination with it will lead me to put aside important things at hand to start reading a newly arrived book—be it the history of the world, or the biography of a personage.</p><p>When I was a child, I enjoyed reading biographies and historical fiction, though I hated it when I was asked to memorize names and dates in history. I’ve found good biographies informative and inspirational. A good biographer tells not only the story of a person, but also of their times. Reading can take me back into history, help me reflect on culture and philosophy, and give me insight into the past, the present, and the future, both predictable and unknown.</p><p>History was always my best and favorite subject in school. I found it much more interesting than math, which usually bored me to tears. History class equals to Not Boring discussions. Why would anyone find history boring? That—I couldn’t figure out.</p><p>If I hadn’t gotten into the Naval Academy of the R.O.C., I would probably have become a college professor and devoted myself to academic study and research. But since my childhood, I had been determined to go to the Naval Academy at Zuo-ying. And so, I stayed in the Navy for 35 years, including the seven years in the Academy. Throughout my life, however, I have never stopped studying and learning history—not as part of an academic career, but as an essential part of my leisure time. </p><p>History is a study of time and change. Studying history is to gain wisdom from the ancients. I believe that even though knowledge changes over time, our world can be a better place if only individuals learn to appreciate collective wisdom and make good use of it. </p><p>Recently, I’ve been reading two books by Jared Diamond—<em>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies,</em> and <em>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed </em>(also titled <em>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive</em>). I found the first book to be excellent writing—very thought-provoking. Actually, I think it should be on everyone’s Must-Read List. It has won the Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction and the Aventis Prize for Best Science Book. A documentary based on this book and produced by the National Geographic Society had been broadcast on PBS in July of 2005.</p><p>The second book is a follow-up. When <em>Guns, Germs, and Steels</em> tells how societies rose up, <em>Collapse </em>shows the opposite—how various past societies declined as a result of their collective actions. The parallels to our current society and to those who have collapsed not long ago are so obviously prophetic that the book deserves to be listed as one of the required school readings. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. The book offers an excellent history lesson on how societies can destroy themselves. Besides being educational, it also provides enjoyable reading. Jared Diamond has a smooth and passionate writing style that enables him to present large amounts of information in a surprisingly easy to read manner. I strongly recommend these two books of his.</p>
