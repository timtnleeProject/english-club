<p><strong>Nov. 18, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>Enn, My Lovely Grandson</em></strong></p><p>Time flies indeed. Enn has gone to school at the Wen-shan Kindergarten for months. Since the day he was born, I have been collecting interesting and fragrant memories about him. </p><p>Around two years ago, our community had a formal dinner on Chinese New Year’s Eve. During eating, we were invited to go on stage to sing songs, and so Enn asked his parents to take him to the front and waited in line to perform. When it was his turn, he sang nothing but just shouted out loud, “<em>Wai-po</em> (外婆)!” Before I could take any picture of him, he had already stepped down the stage. Even so, his tender, innocent voice has been deeply imprinted in my heart.</p><p>One day I asked Enn to retell the story I had just told him to his grandfather. He answered, “No, I can’t. I just can’t get it straight.” </p><p>Enn has a sweet tooth. One day he took a box of candy to his grandpa and demanded that he open it. His grandpa asked, “Why me?” Enn said, “You’re the strongest, aren’t you?” Yes, it’s true that my husband is stronger than any of us.</p><p>Today I brought him to a clinic, where we saw a foreign mother and her son. After we were back home, Enn told his grandfather about the foreigners he met. And when I started to praise the beauty of the foreign kid, my little grandson unexpectedly interrupted and said, “I’m beautiful too.”</p><p>Except for sleeping, Enn is active all day long. Without adults around to keep an eye on him, he easily gets himself into trouble. And he is terribly thin, partly because his parents are both tall and slim, and partly because he usually has a poor diet. Whenever I complained that he was just as skinny as a little monkey because he didn’t eat properly, the kid would disapprove of my criticism and retort, “I’m thin because I’m always sick, not because I eat too little.”</p><p>In the past summer vacation, his mother sent him to a talent school named Good Music for him to learn something new. One day his teacher asked all students, “Have you ever flown a kite?” Some said yes, some said no. But Enn said, “Our kite flew higher and higher but fell down later.” In a similar way, he told me secretly that his grandfather had once driven him through an intersection without watching the traffic light at all while taking him for a ride.</p><p>The other day, Enn agreed to stay over my place without his mother’s company. Unexpectedly, after I tried everything I could think of to make him go to sleep, from telling one after another story to singing one after another lullaby, he refused to fall asleep but kept crying, “I want my mammy, I want my mammy.” Exhausted and angry, I told him, “I’m your mother’s mother.” But he cried even louder, yelling, “I want the mother of my own, I want the mother of my own.”</p><p>Before lunch, I gave him a banana because he asked for it. After eating it, he demanded more. When I refused him, he said, “Two bananas aren’t much at all.”</p><p>Enn has a dazzling collection of toys, especially the superman series. When I got confused by them, he would always patiently explain, “Wai-po, let me teach you. This is a Spiderman, and that is an Invincible Iron King. These are Transformers, and those are Ultramen, Ultra Qs, Ultra Crusaders . . . .”</p><p>In one month, Enn will have been four years old. It’s really stunning to watch him grow day by day. Life is really miraculous. I wish him to grow up smoothly and have a happy and colorful future life.</p>
