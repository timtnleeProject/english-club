<p><strong>Mar. 17, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Self-expectation</em></strong></p><p>What is the aim of living in the world? How many people give a thought to this question? Why do they not consider this big issue of life? They never think of it? Or does it sometimes pop into their minds but is soon driven out? They think it's unusual to think of this question? I don't know. But I often wonder if they are happy or not. Are they really happy, or do they just hypnotize themselves? Or they don't have the slightest idea whether they are happy or not?</p><p>Are you willing to live one minute after another, simply waiting for death to come? Are you not afraid of death? What do you know about after-death? Or you have never thought of this issue which is absolutely important?</p><p>Most people in the world do not know before their death what on earth life is about. I hope I will not be one of them. I hope I can unveil the mysterious mask of life someday. And don't you hope you can, too?</p>
