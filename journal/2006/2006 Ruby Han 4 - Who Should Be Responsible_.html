<p><strong>June 6, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Who Should Be Responsible? </em></strong></p><p>From insider stock trading, illegal lobbying, taking kickbacks from pharmacist companies, bribing government officials, to money laundering, we are dumbfounded by the degradation President Chen’s son-in-law Chao Chien-ming) is capable of. As people say, his crimes are too numerous to record. Although many powerful pieces of evidence were posed against him, he did not at all think he did wrong. How strange it is that he did not feel guilty or ashamed. Not even a bit!.</p><p>Actually, from the First Lady to the two government officials closest to President Chen, Chen Che-nan and Ma Yung-cheng, they are all interested in the stock market. The Presidential Office had almost become a center of insider stock trading for a long time.</p><p>In 2005, a Taiwan entrepreneur named Chen You-hao held a press conference in the Chinese mainland before Taiwan’s  presidential election. Chen said he had been to the president’s residence to deliver in person the political donation to the First Lady, with Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung accompanying him. He swore if he had told a lie, he would jump from a high building. After Chen’s conference, Shen declined to give a clear explanation about it, so the First Lady wanted Chen to simply go ahead and jump because she was innocent. In other words, she was saying that Chen had never entered the president’s residence and given any money to her. But several days ago, Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung confirmed that he and Chen You-hao actually had gotten into the president’s residence together back then. Obviously, the First Lady was lying to the public, but with her power she could cover up all scandals or cheatings and turn black into white. As Shen suggested, Chao Chien-ming’s many ill doings are natural results under the negative influence of his mother-in-law. Such a smart, greedy young man as Chao Chien-ming would certainly agree that persons with ambition must follow previous examples of success. It is clear enough who should be responsible for all these foul deeds.</p><p> The DPP government raised the big banner of honesty and democracy, claiming they are the ones who love Taiwan the most, upholding Taiwanese culture and language by removing whatever is related to Chinese. They go so far as to disallow government-run companies, institutions and even schools to use in their names the character <em>chung</em>, which means either middle or Chinese, and demand them to replace it with <em>tai</em>. As a matter of fact, they love Taiwan’s money and power more than its land and people. If you happen to suggest something good for both sides of the Taiwan Strait, you may be accused by them of either selling Taiwan or surrendering to the PRC. The Presidential Office and residence are rotten with corruption and crime. This government has shamed all Taiwanese people. The faster Chen steps down, the better it would be for Taiwan.</p>
