<p><strong>May 19, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>The Art and Culture Center in Cheng Chi University</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>  </em></strong></p><p>"How can it be?" I kept asking myself when I stepped out from the Art and Culture Center of Cheng Chih University after watching the movie "Amadeus." Little did I expect that the movie talked about Mozart and Antonio Salieri, who was so jealous of Mozart's success at music that he did many bad things to harm Mozart and finally claimed his life.</p><p>When the movie ended, I felt that my heart was stone-heavy. The entire room was so quiet that I could even clearly hear people's breathing. After I left the Art and Culture Center, I finally could not control myself but cried like a baby under a giant tree. It was really hard to accept that such a great musician was buried under with other dead bodies. If Salieri had not harmed Mozart secretly, Mozart should have earned much money and led a great life with his family as his music and opera were so amazing and popular.</p><p>That very night, I went on the Internet to search for information about Mozart. According to some websites, a famous musician named Salieri was said to have pretended to be a man in black and asked Mozart to compose a song for some dead man in three weeks. Therefore, Mozart worked day and night until he died, in the middle of composing the requiem. Salieri finally realized his dream. Another story had it that Salieri did not do anything to harm Mozart, who actually died of some disease caused by hard work. I chose to believe the latter one so that I may be kept from losing faith in humanity.</p><p>As I listened to the classical music channel two days ago, I learned that Mozart's son had composed some great music, too. I felt comforted because previously I only knew when Mozart died, his son was only five or six years old and his family suffered a poor economic condition.</p><p>Around 250 years ago, the genius musician Mozart was born in Salzburg. Though he only lived for 35 years, his music had been passed down to people around the world and is to last forevermore. I did feel it was a great privilege to know him and his music.</p>
