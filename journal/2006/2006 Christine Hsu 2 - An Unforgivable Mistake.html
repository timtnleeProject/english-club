<p><strong>Mar. 31, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>An Unforgivable Mistake</em></strong></p><p>  </p><p>I had never expected any good return by helping people, and certainly would never anticipate any bad consequence from doing good. It was bad enough to lose the file of pictures I took. What's worse, I also lost the pictures which my elder daughter, Emily, had taken during her graduation trip. The digital camera's memory card was totally broken. It happened simply because I helped a friend learn to use a digital camera.</p><p>Last Saturday we went to some volunteer's house for the first gathering of the Wen-Shan district self-helping group. Everything went well until the volunteer asked me to teach her husband how to use the digital camera that they just bought. Not only did I teach him how to take the pictures, I also showed him how to upload pictures to his computer. At that moment I did not realize how stupid I was to do it by using my own memory card. I had done it over 100 times, but for some reason it did not work at the beginning. After trying again and again, I finally made it, but I also got an error message from my memory card, which I ignored, thinking it was just temporarily out of work.</p><p>I could not wait to upload the pictures as soon as I arrived home, but nothing remained in the memory card. All pictures were lost. After trying it several times, I gave it up and revealed the bad news to Emily. She looked at me with "Why is that?" expression and rushed into her room. I could tell how sorrowful she was by her loud cry. My heart was aching as I knew I had made an unforgivable mistake.</p><p>I kept asking myself, "What should I do if the time went back to last Saturday?" Helping friends is good, but it seems I need more wisdom when doing it. I felt a little bit released as Emily quickly let it go after two days. I was amazed at her ability to cope with the frustration and sadness.</p>
