<p><strong>Sep. 13, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Jackie Chen</em></strong></p><p>It amazed me when I heard my little son telling me, "Mom, I want to learn kung-fu to protect my woman." Then on second thought, I understood he was affected by the movies of Jackie Chen. All my family members like to watch his movies, which consist of wonderful stories, magical kung-fu actions and gorgeous settings. Now Jackie is well-known around the world. But for the glamorous success he has paid a great price. Several times he has almost lost his own life for his job. He got hurt often when shooting movies.</p><p>Around seven, Jackie entered into a Chinese opera kung-fu training school. The teacher there was so strict as to whip students who made mistakes or failed to do well. His father had signed a 10-year contract with the teacher, which means he must stay in this hell-like school for 10 years.</p><p>Students there must keep up-side down for over 30 minutes, learning also how to back turn over and standing still in one single posture for over 30 minutes. They must get up early to learn kung-fu and sleep on the stiff ground every day. Not only did they suffer their teacher's beating, but they also had to endure the bullying of the senior students, who were entitled to punish them. Jackie, however, has never hated his teacher. On the contrary, he is thankful for his teaching that has contributed to his present-day great success.</p><p>Before he achieved his success, he had confronted numerous frustrations. Luckily he met one of the best agents, Mr. Chen Zi-Qiang, who has guided, taught, encouraged and helped Jackie all along. Jackie often said, "No Mr. Chen, then no Jackie Chan." Jackie gives out his heart and risks his life in acting out his every role, insisting to perform every action in person, no matter how difficult or dangerous it may be. His blood and sweat is never wasted and his persistent struggle for hard-won success deserves our respect.</p>
