<p><strong>Sep. 1, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Unexpected Gains</em></strong></p><p>Since I began to work three and half days per week, it was hard for me to do the cleaning. Therefore, I assigned my two daughters to mop the floor every Thursday morning.</p><p>Last Thursday, as soon as I arrived home, my younger daughter, Julie, asked me to close my eyes and led me to the sofas in the living room. Following their instruction, I bent my knees to check the ground under the sofa and found it amazingly clean. They took turns to tell me how they cleaned it. They had worked together to move the desk and bike to the dining room before they started their cleaning. They had not only mopped the floor, but also scrubbed it. It usually took them one hour to mop the entire floor, but last Thursday, they spent two hours to finish it. I was so touched and appreciated their thoughtfulness.</p><p>Besides this chore, they have already been washing dishes, dumping garbage, sweeping the floor and folding clothes for a few years. I did not arrange the work shift for them but simply asked them to complete those chores. They use different shapes of magnets for their identities: Emily's is square and Julie's is diamond. They each have four magnets placed on the refrigerator door in two lines, each of which stands for a different chore. Once they finish one kind of chores, they move their own magnet down to the bottom line. Whoever has her magnet on the top line would be the next one to do the chore.</p><p>Seeing them solve problems by themselves eases me. During this summer vacation, they heated their lunch meals, went to the library, visited classmates, and went swimming, all on their own. I did feel sorry for leaving them home alone at the time, but on the other hand, this was a great opportunity for them to learn to be more independent and be responsible for themselves.</p><p>After the new semester begins, we will mop the floor together on weekends as all of us will be fully occupied during weekdays. Sigh: Time flies, especially the happy hours.</p>
