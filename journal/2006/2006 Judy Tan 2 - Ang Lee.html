<p><strong>Mar. 11, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Ang Lee</em></strong></p><p>Ang Lee got an Oscar award for the Best Director with his "The Brokeback Mountain." It's such a great honor to be shared among all Asians. Yes, it is. And it is having the dream that makes all successes and miracles possible. Ang Lee had had the movie dream, and thus he had never given it up even in the six jobless years before his success. He was not an outstanding boy actually; he failed the college entrance exam twice and finally got himself into the Department of Drama at National Art College. After graduation, the only work he could and would do was movie directing. Though his father had always expected him to turn to something else and imposed heavy pressure on him, he never abandoned his ideal.</p><p>He is a person of a romantic feeling and a sensitive heart, so he always hoped to find a woman with a stronger character to marry him. Luckily, his wife is such an independent woman. She could bear with her husband's doing nothing for six years, and she drove the car herself to the hospital to give birth to their first son. One time she just felt she could no longer stand the pressure of life and decided to divorce her husband. After talking to her mother on the phone, she cried for a long time and then made up her mind to accept him for what he was. Her husband had committed no crime but remained jobless only. She is such a great-hearted, strong-minded and brave woman.</p><p>When Ang Lee had chances to direct films, he worked hard and persisted in holding up his idea. It is not easy to control the movie budget and get along with Western big movie stars, especially for an easterner like him. In "The Brokeback Mountain" he shows his open-mindedness and his compassion. He wants people to know love is so great that it is beyond boundary, be it the love between man and woman or between man and man. Ang Lee says he always feels that our society has constrained us to such a degree that we could not even love what we hope to love.</p><p>        </p><p>Ang Lee is a success now. He has proved his talent and insisted on his movie dream, and he will never give it up for sure.</p>
