<p><strong>Apr. 14, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>An Optimistic Lady</em></strong></p><p>  </p><p>It was the second time I met her. She was not a stranger to me anymore as she would be the leader of Wan-Fang Beautiful Life Breast Cancer Patient Group. In the conference, she sat next to me so we talked a lot. I always thought of myself as an optimistic person, but compared with her, I was all gloom.</p><p>She, a single lady, got breast cancer last spring and lost her left breast. The next month, a tiny tumor was found in her right breast. She decided to have another surgery without a second thought. She has received chemotherapy eight times like me but the medicine she took was much stronger. Now she looked bright and healthy. She did not even wear bras. She told the reporters that she felt much more comfortable without it. What touched me most was to hear her say, "When I knew that I got the cancer, I did not act like other patients and ask, 'Why me?' Instead, I am glad that it is me, but not the three of my best friends because they definitely could not undertake this kind of adversity." I thought to myself, "What a compassionate woman she is!" I did not know how hard she had convinced herself to accept such a terrible thing and how many difficulties she had confronted during those horrible treatments, but I could tell, for a woman, it was very tough. I did admire her incredible courage and optimism.</p><p>I believe with her great love and kind heart, our group would be getting stronger and we would fulfill our goal smoothly.</p>
