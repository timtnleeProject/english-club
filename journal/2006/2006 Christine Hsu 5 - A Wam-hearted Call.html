<p><strong>Apr. 21, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>A Warm-hearted Call</em></strong></p><p>  </p><p>A Saturday afternoon two weeks ago, I got a phone call from the Tzu Chi Foreign Language Team (FLT) members who were then on the mission of receiving marrow couriers from 14 countries who came to join the First Asian Bone Marrow Conference in Hualien.</p><p>They told me that most of those marrow couriers knew me, how much they hoped I could have joined them, and how boring it was without my loud talk and funny jokes. They took turns to send me a warm greeting before hanging up the phone. It was so touching to receive this unexpected phone call especially after I had been suspecting what they cared most after all was how much work I could do for FLT, but not me as a friend.</p><p>Such a suspicion, however, did not occur until I had come back from Hualien this March for an FLT task in an annual activity. I had made many efforts for this activity. Even the day before we left for Hualien, I was still working very hard to record some tapes, double-check the train schedule, and so on. I had high expectations for it, but things did not go the way exactly as I planned.</p><p>The second day, while I was happy about finishing the morning class, the following conference depressed me badly. I did not pay much attention to Master Cheng Yen's speech, but reflected on my observations of the FLT members instead. During these two days, no matter what they did, they always behaved properly and obeyed all the rules without any complaints. I suddenly felt that I did not at all belong to the group. I kept thinking why I was there and why I did not in any way change during the past three years after joining this group. I still spoke loudly and did not keep up a good image like the other commissioners. I felt like some sort of tiny dirt had messed up the whole pot of delicious soup.</p><p>What happened next depressed me even more. As all classes in the morning did not finish on time, after lunch, they could not even spare me 10 minutes to rehearse the upcoming sign-language performance rehearsal, but spent 30 minutes taking pictures for all members, which we had already done one day before. I felt that I was totally ignored.</p><p>This incident deeply destroyed my mood and all the good feelings for those members were gone. I even resolved to leave them, my favorite group in Tzu Chi. I left Hualien in a very bad mood and kept that negative thought in mind until I got their call. It seemed they were not as cold-blooded as I thought, or else they would not have thought of me and greeted me. How thoughtful and sweet and what a great surprise it was! I was touched by them but also ashamed of myself for my narrow-mindedness.</p>
