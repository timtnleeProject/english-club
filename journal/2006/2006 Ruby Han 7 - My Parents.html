<p><strong>Nov. 3, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Parents</em></strong></p><p><strong>       </strong></p><p>A limerick was very popular in my neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s, whose lines go as follows:</p><p><em>Rich soldiers, soldiers rich              </em></p><p><em>Make monthly dollars thirty;         </em></p><p><em>Marry wives who have no ears.   </em></p><p><em>   </em></p><p>I grew up in a poor military dependents' community. My parents had wanted me to be a teacher, expecting me to lead an independent life and to help them resolve their financial difficulties. Besides studying hard, I was very well-behaved in my early age. I helped my family to do lots of side jobs such as sticking many bunches of envelopes (a bunch had 100 envelopes) or weaving the baby gloves and stockings.</p><p>Because I always failed math in senior high, I was afraid of taking the College Entrance Examination. It was surprising that math questions given that year seemed too difficult to most students. Over thousands of students got zero for that subject. Ironically, it turned out to be wonderful news to students like me who were poor in math. In fact, I had no idea what I had written on my test paper. I just followed what my teacher had instructed in class: "You should never deliver a test paper without giving a word; the more words, the better." I stuffed it with a lot of words. All in all, I was so lucky to get admitted to Taiwan Normal University at public expense.</p><p>During my nearly 35 years' teaching career, I had handed part of my salary to my parents every month to help them get a better living until they passed away. When I gave birth to my daughter, I rented an apartment next door for my parents to live in, to prevent possible conflicts between them and my husband. My father-in-law used to question me, "Your house is big enough already. Why do you have to rent another apartment for your parents?" I never told him that I felt angry when I saw my mother serve my husband like a maid, always preparing him fruits, tea, or soft drinks. And my husband simply took it for granted. After he got home from work, he always lay on the sofa, watching TV and enjoying my mother's servitude.</p><p>Actually, since I got married, I myself have been having a lot of trouble getting along with my husband. My mother was the kind of person who would worry sick once she heard bad news or happenings--she would not be able to either eat or sleep well. So I never complained about my husband in front of my parents, just to keep them from worrying.</p><p>In general, my parents had lived a well-to-do and worry-free life in their late years. My mother always told her friends and neighbors, "I have a good daughter, who has been sent by the Goddess of Mercy."</p>
