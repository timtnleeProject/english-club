<p><strong>Aug. 11, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Twenty-One Years</em></strong></p><p>What can "21 years" do in one lifetime? It can make a child become an adult, and a middle-aged man an old one. For the three of us knowing each other for ages, "21 years" has witnessed our precious friendship and shared pride.</p><p>Twenty-one years ago, we met in Tamsui. We learned editing skills together and went to interview some shopkeepers on the crowded Chung-Hau Road. Young as we were, we did not vow to be lifelong friends and yet we have remained friends and kept gathering once a year during the past 10 years. Another amazing thing is that we got to know Buddhism through different groups of friends and then have all become vegetarian. "Having delectable cuisine" is one of the reasons why I like to stay with them.</p><p>In the past July, we luckily got a chance to have a tour inside the La-Fa-Ye warcraft and a submarine. And as it was the last of exhibition days, the soldiers performed marvelous shows which were a special treat for our eyes. All of us left with complete satisfaction.</p><p>On the same day, we also visited the Fishman Dock, and took the True-love Boat from the True Love Dock to Chi-Jing. The most attractive places were the parks built along the seashore. All of us were intoxicated with the breath-taking sunset scenery. We planned to come back to ride a bike next time. I did admire people in Kaohsiung for leading such a vivid nightlife. And the richly decorated restaurants there provided pleasant atmosphere and delicious food much cheaper than we imagined.</p><p>No trip to Kaohsiung would be complete without visiting Shi-Chi Bay, which was one of the eight great sceneries in Kaohsiung. We had dinner at a restaurant inside the British Consulate, which, standing up on the hill, was the best place for admiring the splendid night view of Kaohsiung dock. </p><p>Walking down the long stairway, we said our goodbye without sadness but happiness in mind, as we all knew that to part was to meet again. My dear friends, it is so wonderful to have you, and see you all next year!</p>
