<p><strong>Apr. 7, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Romance</em></strong></p><p>  </p><p>Last Saturday night, my husband came back with two boxes of visible stickers for healing pimples. He fervently showed me how to use it and how amazing it was. When he carefully helped me to use it, I suddenly thought of an email that I read a few days ago.</p><p>In the email, a wife complained to her husband about the lack of romance in life. Her husband explained that it was all because she was not mindful enough. Since then, the wife unwillingly began to find something romantic in her husband. Early one morning, she heard the romantic sound while her husband was washing the dishes which she had left in the sink the night before. It was very dark. The wife asked her husband, "Why don't you turn on the light?" He answered, "I am afraid to wake you up."</p><p>One noon, her husband was watching TV in the lowest volume. She asked him, "Why don't you turn it up?" Her husband answered softly as usual, "Because you are sleeping." She continued, "Do you feel unlucky to have a wife who does not get up until noon during holidays?" Her husband said more softly, "Not at all. I can look at you to my heart's content while you are sleeping." She finally realized how she had been ignoring the romance surrounding her all along.</p><p>In our 15 years' marriage, both my husband and I have never considered romance an important issue. I never complain about it like the wife mentioned above. My husband and I cannot even remember our own wedding anniversary though we write it down on the calendar every year. We always missed it and would only remember it the next day. Last Saturday, I did enjoy my husband's sweet care, which I thought could be regarded as a sort of romance.</p><p>Another romance was between my new MP3 and me. Since last Saturday morning, I began to take a walk in the early morning. From my house, I could view the beauty of Daonan Riverside Park, but walking there was superb, especially in the early morning. Listening to my favorite songs and walking on the riverside with gentle breeze softly caressing my face is a sensation beyond compare.</p>
