<p><strong>April 15, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Something about Learning English</em></strong></p><p>I plan to take the General English Proficiency Test this year. I had been thinking of the intermediate level, but I was advised to try the elementary level first and then the intermediate level next year. I agree with that. I’m weak at listening comprehension and kind of worried about it. That’s one of the reasons why I am here in this class. Although I have only attended one class, I think I can benefit much from my studying here. </p><p>The test style of GEPT is strange for us, the students of the older generation who are comparatively better at reading but poorer at listening, speaking and writing. It’s hard to conquer this difficulty we’re facing. Yet the GEPT emphasizes equally the four aspects mentioned above. Nowadays’ students, unlike us, who are used to silent reading, are provided with authentic learning methods. Does the GEPT come too late for us? Are we too late for that? Probably not. We can always improve as long as we want to be better at English in these four aspects.</p><p>Learning English is fun in some way. However, it can be a hard job when you have difficulty understanding the content. As a learner of English as a second language, I think my learning environment is bad. I don’t even know how to learn English effectively. As for others, the limited number of people who pass the GEPT annually has indicated the problem is common.</p><p>Language is a tool for communication. Practice makes perfect. If we use it as much as foreigners do, we can have equally good commandy da of it some day. But here in Taiwan, it’s hard for people to actually use it every day, since there are few English native speakers around. To improve this, we must practice English harder by ourselves. However, it’s still hard for the average person to learn it on their own. Fortunately, the English TV programs and other English media available in daily life can help, though not much.</p><p>Heaven helps those who help themselves. We can be good at English, if we want to. If a person studies English every day, he can make progress little by little. Let’s go for it!</p>
