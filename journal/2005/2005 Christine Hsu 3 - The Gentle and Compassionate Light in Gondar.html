<p><strong>April 15, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>The Gentle and Compassionate Light in Gondar</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>I found myself always getting gains unexpectedly. Every Thursday I would go to Wan-Fang Library after I attended the school's morning activity. Last Thursday, I forgot it was a regular day off but still went on schedule. Before going home, I stopped by the post office to pay the visa card fee. While I was waiting, from a heap of books that I planned to return to the library, I picked up an English translation of a Chinese book, "The Gentle and Compassionate Light in Gondar." I took it at random, but it gave me an enormous touching feeling that I had not had for a long time.</p><p>At the beginning, I thought it was just a story about a person's first experience of being a volunteer to contribute food in Ethiopia. Not until the poor little girls showed up in the story did I feel that I could not move my eyes away from the book. The two little girls whose father and brothers died of famine had climbed over three mountains and walked for three days in the hope of getting some food. The author-volunteer wanted to help them, but the soldier beside him pushed away those girls with his rifle. They vanished in the crowd and the volunteer did not find them until the next morning. An old man not only took them in and shared his only food with them but also gave them some more to take home for their blind mother.</p><p>I worried about the frightened little girls as badly as the author-volunteer did when they tried to escape. I did think they would die in the cold night without food and warm clothes. The old man not only saved the girls' lives but also saved mine for I would definitely have cried to death if things had turned otherwise. In contrast with the soldier who pushed off the little girls, the old man was like a living Bodhisattva that Master Cheng-Yen always encouraged us to be. "Can you share what makes you happy with the two little girls from a far-away town even if it means you might starve to death?" I could not find a "yes" to this question, but the old man did it without hesitation. I felt something stuck in my throat that I could hardly continue reading. I admired most of the Tzu-Chi volunteers who had been contributing themselves wholeheartedly to people in need, but I admired this old man even more.</p><p>It was such an enlightening and touching story that I could not wait to share it with all my friends. It took me almost one day to convert it into an electronic book, but it was absolutely worthwhile. I knew I would learn more by reading friends' feedback on the story.</p><p>The translator's words printed on the cover page seized my attention before I closed the book: She read this book accidentally just like me. One day during her stay in Japan at her daughter's place, her granddaughter read this book and tearfully told her how miserable the little girls were. She quickly glanced at the page her granddaughter read and the front page. From it, she saw one of the two girls carrying a bag so she told her granddaughter, "See, they must have arrived home safely." She decided to translate this story into Chinese in order for all Taiwanese to know that there were two million children actually sleeping in hunger every day.  I was deeply grateful to her from all my heart.</p>
