<p><strong>Oct. 21, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>True Stories</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>This true story happened in Kaohsiung. At almost the same time, two pregnant women decided to donate their unborn babies' umbilical cord blood to the Tzu-Chi Foundation. Two groups of volunteers went to get some necessary information from them and began to visit them regularly. </p><p>After a few months, one of them gave birth to a pair of twins, one of whom, however, died. The other woman gave a premature delivery. Both women could not have their babies donate their umbilical cord blood because the blood was too little to save another life.</p><p>After another few months, the mother with a premature baby rang one of our volunteers to ask about the donated breast milk in the Tzu-Chi Foundation. The doctor strongly suggested her baby to have breast milk, but she was too weak to offer it herself. Of course we did not have such donors. Through a regular meeting, the other volunteers knew about it and helped the mother to get breast milk from the other mother with twins.</p><p>After a period of time, the premature baby's mother asked our volunteers to arrange a meeting for her to thank the generous donor. When the donor knew about it, she told our volunteers that meeting that mother and baby was exactly what she longed to do as soon as she donated her breast milk. She continued, "In the delivery room, I told my dead baby that as we had no affinity to be family, I hope you could find better parents." And so, she secretly regarded the baby who sucked her milk as the incarnation of her dead baby.</p><p>The other true story was about a bone marrow donor. When she knew that she could donate her bone marrow, she wanted our volunteer to convey her gratitude to the patient-receiver. She said that six years before, her father had a severe car accident and was sent to the hospital. In the emergency room, her mother and she begged the doctor to do his best to save her father's life. Finally they could do nothing but to watch her father die. At that very moment, she thought to herself how much she hoped she could extend a person's life even for only one day, but she never got the chance. Two years later, her sister got into a car accident. Her mother and she again begged the doctor in the emergency room to save her sister's life, but her sister lost her life in the end. At that moment, the thought came back to her mind that she wished she could have saved her sister's life. So when she got the news that she could save someone's life, her happiness was indescribable. She finally could realize her vow.</p><p>I do admire these three women, especially the mother with twins, whose words deeply touched me. Being a mother myself, her great maternal love made me burst into tears. Because of their magnanimous act and kind hearts, those strange people from all over the world get to know each other and become good friends. Each of their stories is so touching and meaningful.</p>
