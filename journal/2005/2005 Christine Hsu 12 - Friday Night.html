<p><strong>Nov. 4, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Friday Night</em></strong></p><p>        </p><p>"Purify my heart, cleanse me, oh, my Lord..." We sang the song over and over again last Friday night at a place which was called the church but did not look like a church at all. Before singing some Christian songs and poems, we played a game called "two truths and one lie." Everyone had to tell a friend who sat beside him three stories in English. And the listener had to guess which one was a lie. My daughters could only say three very simple sentences but we still had fun. After singing, two teachers of Studio Classroom went on stage to talk about how much more important it was to cleanse our hearts than to keep a neat outlook. After reading the English Bible on my hand, I realized that what they had talked about was related to the topic we were going to study from the Bible.</p><p>I had heard about this activity from the radio for many years, but I paid little attention to it as I was not a Christian. And I had had a very bad experience with the Bible. One year ago, one of my friends insisted on coming to my house to read the Bible with me every Wednesday morning. It was really hard for me to remember the stories of those people, such as Peter, David and James Legge, etc. After six months, I finally stopped the boring Bible study.</p><p>It was Vivian, one of my best friends, who raised my interest in this activity. She had been bringing her son to join the English Bible Study over three times a month and both of them enjoyed it very much. Being a Christian, she thought the activity helped her son not only study English but also learn more about God. She fervently recommended it to my daughters as she believed our kids would improve their English by soaking themselves in such an environment. I had been very busy in the past three weeks and so I did not join it until last Friday. On our way to the meeting place, my elder daughter, Emily, kept saying that she was not interested in it at all. But after having participated in all activities Friday evening, she told me that she would attend it regularly even though I could not accompany her.</p><p>Because we were newcomers, we did not study the Bible but played some games with other newcomers. The most interesting one was finding someone who ate a lot of candy or read a book last week. We got 20 questions to ask our new friends and those who answered yes to the question should sign their names under the question. Whoever got the greatest number of signatures would be the winner. I quickly moved myself among others and asked them questions speedily. In the end, I got 19 signatures and won the game. Later, the teacher asked us to get to a group of four and discuss the best way to improve English. To my great surprise, more than four groups thought that the best way was to talk with themselves in all possible occasions, such as taking a shower, walking and shopping. The teacher, however, suggested we read the ingredients, directions, or any other information indicated in English on the cover of the food package. I thought this was a brilliant idea, too.</p><p>I got very different thoughts about God after joining this activity. All the songs we sang were about how God loved people no matter who you were and what you were. During that whole night, I felt relaxed and the atmosphere there was full of joy. I believe that Buddha and God both teach us to be good, but Christian activity seems more interesting and pleasant. I am not sure whether I have made a correct observation, but I am certain I will keep joining this activity with my kids.</p>
