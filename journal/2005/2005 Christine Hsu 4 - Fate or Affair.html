<p><strong>April 22, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Fate or Affair</em></strong></p><p>One of Tzu-Chi members told Master Cheng-Yen that she didn't know how to cope with the pain caused by her husband's betrayal. The Master wanted her not to call it a betrayal, but her fate, her karma, and also asked her to continue loving her husband as well as the third party.</p><p>This was what I learned from the Foreign Language Team members last Friday. I totally disagreed with it though I had been educated to love all beings in the world. If I were the betrayed wife, forgiving my husband was the bottom line. I would certainly lose my mind if asked to also love the woman he loved. "Be honest, could you love the person your wife loved?" I asked all male members in the class. I wondered if the Master would give the same advice to a male member and why she called it fate. Or did the Master just want us to justify the mistake so that all couples could keep their marriage going on?</p><p>Some of my friends got divorced because of extra-marital affairs. Needless to say, we all sympathized with the woman whose husband had an affair. In my friends' cases, I found the affair was caused by both the wife and the husband. It was unfair to condemn only one side. The causes of betrayal are various, and I disagree that fate should be the only reason. When we talk about fate, we tend to think that all present faults are caused by our past lives, that we can do nothing about it but only accept it and try to do more good deeds to get better karma for our next life.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Master told the members to warm her husband's heart with her sincere love. Was it worthwhile to save a miserable marriage? Was it fair that the wronged wife had to go through pain and torture when the guilty husband should be forgiven and even rewarded? I did not think the wife needed to compromise out of consideration for general interest. </p><p>That night, we studied almost the same topic about betrayal and its solution. Was it women's fate to bear with such silliness in our society? I felt aggrieved but also confused about whether to obey reluctantly or defy consistently.</p>
