<p><strong>April 22, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>A Trip to My Hometown</em></strong></p><p>I went back home, my birth place, with my sister this month to sweep my ancestors’ tombs. I got up very early that morning, so that I could catch the first bus home. As we arrived at the main station, we were told that tickets for the first bus were sold out. So we took the private-run bus instead to Taichung and then transferred to Changhwa. Since it was not a non-stop, it took us much more time to get to our destination.</p><p>We arrived at my eldest sister's house so early that we had lunch together. In the afternoon I went to my birthplace, where I saw many of my relatives who were waiting to go to the graveyard. We cleaned the yard for a while and spread paper money all over the tombs as custom required. We didn’t stay there very long.</p><p>After some chats with old friends and relatives at dinner, we were ready to return to Taipei. It was a long trip. When I got home, it was already late at night.</p>
