<p><strong>May 05, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>To Marry, or Not to Marry</em></strong></p><p>Most married women, while getting together, always complain, "If I were to be given a second chance, I wouldn't choose marriage." "In fact, marriage seldom benefits most women. Marriage is just a chain that binds people, especially women." "What's worse, women are led and confined unknowingly by the traditions to carry the family responsibility." I, however, think otherwise: not only is marriage predestined, but it also can be a life-long career.</p><p>During such a life-long career, we have tasted the sour, the sweet, the spicy, as well as the bitter, by playing the roles of daughter, wife and mother. From such experiences we have gained wisdom, nurtured judgment and learned our lessons, and then our personality becomes mature gradually. Now it would be unfair to consider marriage as something false and to be regretted. Though it's true we sacrifice a lot for the sake of our family, still, we got experiences more than valuable.</p><p>Most people are quite used to seeing things from their own point of view and discourage others from marrying. They always say, "Marriage is a grave of love." Those who are married envy the singles who can enjoy complete freedom to do whatever they like. They don't have to make any decisions for others, or take responsibility for the family. They just have to take care of themselves, and can lead a fantastic life. But in my opinion, these people, no matter how carefree they may appear, miss the opportunity to play various roles and grow. Most likely, they would feel alone and helpless when they encounter difficulties in their life journey.</p><p>It is no doubt that not all women have the privilege to choose to stay single. Some of them have no other options than marriage because they have no skills to make a living on their own. And most people who encourage a single life are all married. Can you be sure that staying unmarried is the right thing to do?</p>
