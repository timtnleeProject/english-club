<p><strong>May 13, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Precious Friendship</em></strong></p><p>It is hard to make a real friend on the Internet as most people tend to use fake identities. I prefer to be honest right from the beginning rather than to lie myself out of lies in the end. With this sincere manner, I do meet many kind people on the Internet. Among them, Isabel is the best.</p><p>In March 2002, two months before the last chemotherapy, I decided to go abroad after receiving all treatments. Planning the trip did extremely excite me and help me recover rapidly.  Because the airplane would stop at Singapore before heading for Melbourne, I decided to take the great advantage and stop over there for a couple of days. As a result, I began to search for female friends on the Internet and found Isabel. She not only verbally introduced all tourist attractions to me, but also suggested some relative websites. To my great surprise, she volunteered to be my guide. When some of my friends knew about this, they became suspicious and asked me not to trust and meet her in person.</p><p>Being a patient, I got much more time to be online, so I talked with Isabel almost every day. She even called me every time before and after I went for chemotherapy. The warmth of her words strengthened me and enabled me to overcome the side-effects I suffered. She is more than a net friend to me.</p><p>During my visit to Singapore, she treated me as her precious guest. She only got a little money from some part-time jobs but insisted on paying for me every meal. Furthermore, she even prepared a prepaid transportation card for me in advance. With her excellent guide, I got the chance to view the spectacular scenery of Singapore at the 70th floor of a skyscraper free of charge and had an enjoyable time in Sentosa. It has become a special and unforgettable memory of mine that we laboriously moved through the crowd at an outdoor plaza to watch the 2002 FIFA (Federation International de Football Association) World Cup and together cheered for the team we supported.</p><p>Last year, she decided to get married with her Holland-born boyfriend, whom she also met on the Internet. She finally realized her dream to marry abroad, but she was not always so lucky. When I knew her, she was suffering from a broken relationship. Every time we talked, she would mention how painful she was and asked me how to overcome it. With my insufficient experiences, I really did not know how to heal her broken heart. Luckily, she found her true love, a handsome single man with a great job at the Netherlands Railroad Company.</p><p>During the past four years, we shared our happiness and sadness and all secrets with each other. Though we live in different countries, both of us believe that we can maintain our friendship well through the Internet.</p>
