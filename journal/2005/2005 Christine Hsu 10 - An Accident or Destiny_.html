<p><strong>Oct. 14, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>An Accident or Destiny?</em></strong></p><p><em> </em></p><p>Mr. Chiu, whose car door I hit by accident last Saturday, rang me again. He told me that he did not have insurance to cover up the damage. Meanwhile, he questioned me if I already asked my insurance company to handle the car accident. He had checked with my insurance company but they could not find any records. He also told me that I might only get partial compensation as both parties were to blame for the accident. He kept saying that my repair cost was too high. His uncle could give me a better price. Listening to his every single word, I kept wondering why he rang me and what he wanted me to do. I did not respond to him much, but simply answered "Yes" or "Hmm." In my heart, I was ready to pay for the repair all by myself. It sounded silly, but only by thinking this way could I release myself from anger and hatred.</p><p>Last Saturday morning, I was supposed to join a bone marrow drive at Banqiao. Only five minutes after I left home, when I passed a row of cars parking on my right hand side, I heard a crash and my rear-view mirror fell down. I stopped my car immediately. At that moment I thought to myself, "I must have hit some car's rear-view mirror. Fortunately, a mirror would not be a big deal." After picking up the mirror and turning back, I saw a man get out of his car. Without second thought, I went closer and said sorry to him. Seeing his car door, I realized that I did not hit his car's mirror, but the door instead. Putting the mirror back to my own car, I almost fainted to find the greatest damage to my car that I had ever had. Aware of the serious situation, I went back to tell the driver, Mr. Chiu, that my insurance company would pay for his car damage. But to my great surprise, he didn't even know if he himself had such car insurance or not.</p><p>The police finally arrived after keeping us waiting for 30 minutes. Mr. Chiu did not think it was his fault and insisted on sending this case to the court. But as soon as he knew from his uncle that our cars could not be fixed until the verdict was reached, he changed his mind to suggest that I pay for his repair and he paid for mine instead of waiting for the verdict as it would be one month long. But he was worried that my repair would cost more than his so he asked me not to send my car to the company where I bought it. To eliminate his worry, I rang the salesman of the company to see if he could send someone to check my car. He did not send anyone to me, but told me that I could have my car fixed before receiving the verdict. Knowing this situation, we both agreed to send this case to the court.</p><p>To me, the accident was bad, but to let Mr. Chiu know I was a Tzu-Chi commissioner was worse. As soon as I had confirmed the repair fee, I rang to tell him. He said that he could not accept that price. That very night, he rang and told me lots of things about his family and Tzu-Chi Foundation, and how his mother asked him to let go instead of worrying about it in the following 30 days. Meanwhile, he complained badly how speedily I drove that morning. He even tried to teach me how to drive. I felt guilty and began to blame myself. There were a lot of "if"s and question marks in my heart. "Did I really drive too fast?" "If I had not driven in the slow lane, I would not have hit his car." But what if he had not opened the car door so recklessly? Was it not the main cause of the accident?</p><p>During these days, I kept thinking that if I had not passed there or Mr. Chiu had opened the door one second later, the accident might have never occurred. I recalled what I read in the book Master of Love and Mercy, where Cheng Yen said, "Whoever we meet, it is all part of the last life's Karma and this life's affinity. If we had treated them well in our previous lifetime and have good affinity with them in this life, we can get along well with them. " Mr. Chiu's unreasonable blaming did aggrieve me, but I think that he and I might have had a bad time during our previous lifetime and yet we have not gained enough good affinity this life so the accident happened. I only hope that we would live peacefully from now on and that he would make no more annoying phone calls.</p>
