<p><strong>May. 26, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Love Story        </em></strong><em> </em>               </p><p>555They love each other but they can"t be together. He couldn't accept her because of her rich family but they finally got engaged. He felt better to escape the decision of their marriage for he was called up for military service. He encouraged her to study abroad. They contacted me by letter then.</p><p>He worded hard after finishing the military service half year later, unfortunately he was broken one leg by traffic accident and he dared his fiancée would worry about him so he didn"t tell her at all. During in the hospital time, there was a nurse who took good care for him. He simply thought that the nurse who worked so kind in the National Taiwan University Hospital could provide so good nursing till the chef of the nurses told him, "You are idiot she love you already." Oh, no, he told her that he had engagement but the nurse still fell in love him even helping him rehabilitation after he had recovered back home.</p><p>He could not but accept as their parents hastened them to get married. He tried hard to collect enough money back from his ex- fiancée who had given his parents money to rebuild their house before. His ex-fiancée"s uncle refused to send the money to his ex-fiancée for him and the next day his ex-fiancée came back blaming him seriously because she couldn’t accept this fact at all. She loved and waited for him for a long time. How could he betray her?</p><p>He spent many days pacifying her and encouraged her to accept one of his best friend's love who had been loving her for a long time. She barely marries his friend but never forgets him. Even though they lived in the USA, she quite often came back to Taiwan to visit him and gave birth to only one girl. Her husband asked him to bring her to go traveling for a few days to please her. He never failed to reserve two rooms in the hotel.</p><p>It was painful for him to have such a heavenly burden of love debt in his whole life. Once she asked him to go to the USA and her younger generation called him " uncle". He just denied right away but they knew a lot about their love story.</p><p>It was creditable that his ex-fiancée never gave her love up for over 40 years.</p>
