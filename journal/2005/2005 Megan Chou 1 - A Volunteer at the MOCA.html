<p><strong>Feb. 3, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Volunteer at the MOCA</em></strong></p><p>To be a volunteer at an art museum is a special kind of experience. I took the job a few months ago. During this period, I was led into a different world that I had never had a chance to browse through.</p><p>The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) building stands on Chang-An Road between the Taipei Railway Station and the South-West Market. Years ago she was the office of the Taipei City Government. As a beautiful designated historic site, she is telling you about the old story from her appearance and memory. Even more amazingly, the building is linked with the Chien-Chen Middle School. If she is the face, then the school must be her arms, its playground her belly, and it's bell-house her bottom. That's why the MOCA can attract famous designers and foreign art institutions to hold exhibitions there. Contemporary art on a historic site! But I feel a little confused: What is contemporary art, and what is a historic building?</p><p>The exhibits that I was in charge of were "The Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Yellow Peril." The MOCA invited 19 architecture designers from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. They presented their ideas through their creative works based on the main topic given by the MOCA.</p><p>Sometimes standing by the art works, I can hardly realize the true feeling from the designers. I don't know the precise meaning of contemporary art. One volunteer tried to define it as "something you can't understand but can feel." That's why I feel a little frustrated--It is simply hard to feel it! Now I know a volunteer should tell himself: "You don't necessarily know everything but there's always someone you can serve; it's enough." That's a volunteer's duty.</p><p>Although I left the job that puzzled me a great deal, I have got much knowledge regarding art, became interested in whatever kind of exhibition, and gained ever-more feelings from different art corners. I am now, for example, enjoying Taipei Fine Arts Museum's exhibition called "Century of Treasury--Highlights from the Permanent Collection," which encompass the diverse development of the 20th century modern art with its over 3,800 art pieces and are on display from Feb. 5, 2005 to Jan. 15, 2006.</p>
