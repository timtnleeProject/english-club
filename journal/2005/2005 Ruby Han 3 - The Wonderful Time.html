<p><strong>Oct. 27, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Wonderful Time         </em></strong></p><p> </p><p>Around 3 pm on Sept. 28, a chisel-well worker Liu Jeng-te was accidentally buried nine meters deep down underground when he was on duty. Hearing this news, Chang Tian-tsi, at 68, went down into the well to rescue his elder cousin. But unfortunately, Chang was also buried five meters deep down with stones and soils continually falling down into the well. Chang was later saved around 10 pm by the special rescuers of Taichung County's fire fighting team. When people asked Chang why he risked his own life by jumping into the well, he said Liu had once saved his life and they were sworn brothers.</p><p>During the digging for the rescue mission, Liu's 80-year-old elder sister rushed to the scene of the accident and knelt down with her arms lifted, calling God to help her younger brother. At 9:40 am on the same day, a few people heard some faint sound crying for help from seven meters down below. Afterwards, when Liu's worker-cap was found, cheers were heard all over. The special rescue team, working even harder now, found at 2:20 pm the trapper Liu's head. Both people in the scene and those in front of TV were first relaxed and then got very excited.</p><p>At this time all of the rescue team members left the spot and the special chisel-well workers took over the digging and rescuing work. Making a bag as a buffer with leaves and weed, they dropped it into the hole to keep the stones or soils from falling down and to maintain some air to help Liu breathe smoothly. All, including Liu's four sons, dug the earth with their hands. Around 5 pm Liu was finally saved and sent to the hospital. Liu appeared weak but felt happy for his own good luck.</p><p>It is amazing that Liu could actually survive after being buried for 26 hours. Liu said he had tried to keep awake and stay sober the best he could and the thoughts of his lovable family gave him a strong desire for living. A devout Christian, he asked God to help him out.</p><p>After an eight-day observation in the hospital, the doctor claimed Liu's kidney to be healthy although he had soaked in a lot of dirty air. Now the Labor Affairs Committee had appointed Liu and Chang as the labor safety ambassadors to share their experience of narrow escape and advise people how to deal with an outburst of danger. Keeping calm is the most important in the face of whatever sort of accident, according to Liu and Chang.</p><p>In this cold, greedy and violent society, such a story is a rare case that shows the value of family relationship, friendship, wisdom, perseverance and high team spirit. Such a communal sharing of joy and sorrow is really a wonder and beauty for all of us in Taiwan.</p>
