<p><strong>Feb. 20, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>Telling a Lie  </em>         </strong>            </p><p>It is dangerous to live in a world full of lies because you will never know for sure what the truth is. Undoubtedly if you are accustomed to telling lies, then nobody will believe you. It is a shame that sometimes we are forced to tell a lie. "Do you have confidence in our company?" my boss asked. "Sure. Of course," I answered without even thinking. Actually I really did not know.</p><p>Rumor has it that one of my colleagues has been divorced already, but she never admits it. It seems that she pretends to still own a happy marriage. But whenever she talks about her "husband," we cannot be sure whether she is referring to her ex-husband or her new boyfriend. It is incredible that she can tell a lie as easily as she drinks water. I have doubted whatever she says.</p><p>It is common for us to tell a lie by making exaggerations. "It is very suitable for you, and this outfit can last over 10 years," the salesperson said. I paid NT$1,200 for that suit but I have never touched it for over one month up till now. How stupid I was to believe such a big lie.</p><p>We always hate people who tell a lie. But sometimes we will be delighted to hear a lie because the truth can be too cruel to accept. I wonder why children never tell a lie while adults seldom tell the truth. "Mommy, you look really ugly in this picture," my little son said matter-of-factly. I was speechless when trying hard to put up a smile.</p>
