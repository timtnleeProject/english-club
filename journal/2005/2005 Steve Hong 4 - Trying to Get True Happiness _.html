<p><strong>Sep. 29, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Trying to Get True Happiness        </em></strong></p><p>Why do I say I’m trying to get true happiness  instead of getting true happiness? Because I have not gotten true happiness yet. At most I am just trying. Everyone is eager to be happy and trying to avoid anything that may make him unhappy, isn’t he? But, how many people really get true happiness?</p><p>Watch TV or read newspapers and you will find that most of the news is unhappy. What on earth is happening in the world? It’s horrible. Are people in the world subject to destiny? Can’t we do something to improve? Are we destined to experience one after another misery?</p><p>It’s very important to get happiness and get rid of unhappiness. And it’s especially important to get true happiness. I don’t know what true happiness is. I haven’t experienced it, but I believe that there must be true happiness.</p><p>I believe true happiness should be an eternal bliss. The happiness that does not last is false. If I am very hungry, I will feel happy to eat as much as I can. But when I am full or even overstuffed, then the feeling of happiness during my eating vanishes, or I even feel unhappy again. So the happiness which may change is not real. True happiness never changes.</p>
