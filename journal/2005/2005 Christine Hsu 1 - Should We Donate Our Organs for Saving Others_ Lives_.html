<p><strong>March 18, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Should We Donate Our Organs for Saving Others' Lives?</em></strong></p><p>One Chinese custom has it that a complete body of a deceased person has to remain intact. It is a way to show our respect to the deceased. In my opinion, as the medical skill has progressed gradually and organ-transplantation skill is widespread, we should not adhere to the outdated custom but donate our organs to save others' lives.</p><p>Two months ago, an event shook our society that a little four-year-old girl known as Chiu was turned down by all hospitals in Taipei for no ward was available. Somehow, she was sent to a children's hospital in Taichung. Afterwards, the Taipei City Government began to examine the patient transmitting system but unexpectedly found that two doctors had fabricated medical records, which shocked the medical world. Though the doctors devoted themselves wholeheartedly to healing the girl, she still failed to make it. Her family could not let go and feel agonized but they finally decided to donate the girl's organs. Her kidney and liver saved a 50-year-old woman and a 6-year-old girl respectively. As a result of her family's great love, this shocking and mournful tragedy turned to be a touching story.</p><p>A few years ago I had registered to donate my organs at a charity bazaar hosted by the Tzu-Chi Foundation, but I could donate none of mine since I got breast cancer 4 years ago. I even could not donate my body to Medical College because of my lack of an ovary and a breast. While visiting Tzu-Chi Medical College, on one bulletin board I saw, "The last operation students practice in Medical College serves as the first in their life-long career as a doctor." The principal shared a story with us that a donor, before death, said to the students, "I would rather you make 1,000 wrong cuts on me than you make one single mistake on a patient's operation." Such an unselfish mind! None of us could stop feeling touched and admiring the great donor.</p><p>Nowadays, everyone knows the importance of environmental protection and recycling. But not just those iron cans, paper and plastic materials, our organs and bodies, too, can be recycled. Once we die, our organs are useless for us, but they would be of great value for dying patients. Let us be a wise person to give our great love and do the last good deed for people and ourselves before we die.</p>
