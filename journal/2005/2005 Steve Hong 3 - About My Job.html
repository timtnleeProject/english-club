<p><strong>May 20, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>About My Job    </em></strong></p><p>I graduated from Central Police College, which is called Central Police University now, but my job is somewhat different from those of policemen as seen on the streets.</p><p>Soon after my graduation, I was appointed a deskbound, nine-to-five position at a local police bureau. Fortunately, I also worked as an acting department chief, which, though only for a short time, gave me the great opportunity to step out of the office and have real contact with people, but, of course, there was greater danger also.</p><p>At the age of nearly 30, I became a foreign affairs police officer due to my specialty in English language. It did not last very long. After a few years I changed my service unit. Now I am working in the civil defense unit, where I have stayed for more than ten years.</p><p>My present duty is quite unlike that of an average policeman, but functions mainly in war time. On regular days, we just do some routine jobs, such as testing the communication systems, performing maneuvers, standing by for orders of emergency, etc.</p><p>I think jobs cannot be classified into the noble and humble ones. Every job is a good job as long as itâ€™s legal and does certain good to living beings in one way or another.</p>
