<p><strong>Nov. 12, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do One Good Deed Every Day</em></strong></p><p>One day when my friend and I were chatting while sitting on the bench at the bus stop near the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, an elderly man came with a stick for support, so my friend offered him her seat at once. Soon, the man got on the bus and left. My friend resumed her seat and continued chatting. Unexpectedly, an old woman showed up. My friend again stood up and yielded her seat to another stranger until our bus arrived.</p><p>A member of the English Club I now join not only brings an eraser to wipe the whiteboard clear but provides markers of all colors for both teacher and students to use for every class. He always volunteers to make copies of handouts for everybody or do other chores to help his classmates. This is Jim, a man who always happily serves the needs of club members without asking for return.</p><p>About one year ago, when I was on the bus heading for work, I saw a woman who was ready to get off the bus pulling a trolley cart piled with vegetables, food and many other things. I rushed to the bus door to help the woman get off before I delivered the trolley cart to her. I could not imagine how terrible it would have been if the cart had been overturned and the stuff inside had been scattered all over. </p><p>On the other day, a janitor of the library borrowed a pen from me to sign up on the work schedule table. As soon as he signed it, he returned the pen back to me. Suddenly, it occurred to me that it must be very inconvenient for the janitors to carry a pen with them when they went to work. The next day, I went there again and tied a ballpoint pen to a plastic folder hung on the wall so that the janitors could use the pen to sign on the form kept inside the folder for checking themselves in. I’m glad to find out that the pen has still been there after months.</p><p>More than often, there are many things we CAN’T do: we can’t invent devices to benefit people, we can’t run a big business to revive the country’s economy, and we can’t go to the battlefield to fight against the enemy. So, what should, or can, we do in such a short life of ours? As the saying goes, “Do a good deed every day.” To help those in need, we can donate to the charities money, things or invoices, we can buy things from the mentally or physically retarded peddlers, or we can adopt an orphan at home or abroad by donating NT$600-1,000 per month.</p><p>As our ancestors said, “Do good deeds, no matter how small it is.” Doing good deeds not only warms people around us but also helps us live a happier and more meaningful life.    </p>
