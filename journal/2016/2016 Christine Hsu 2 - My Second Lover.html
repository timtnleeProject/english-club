<p><strong>Apr. 22, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Second Lover</em></strong></p><p>“Go find some exercise and fall in love with it. That’s the best way to keep doing it.” A doctor said this in a speech two years ago and I totally agreed with him. I must have fallen for swimming so that I have been able to do it almost every day for two decades.</p><p>Last June, my elder daughter asked me to jog with her after dinner as she thought that I had wasted too much time watching TV. I refused her a few times because I thought swimming every day was enough for me and I hated the feeling of perspiration all over my hairs, my forehead, my eyes, my cheeks and my neck. Besides, I had been told that running could hurt knees badly. But looking at my belly fat, I decided to try it once a week. Not surprisingly, it was just as hard as I had thought.</p><p>At the beginning, whenever I started running, I felt I could not breathe and that my heart was going to stop even after I slowed it down. Running 200 meters almost killed me, which frustrated me very much. When I was just about to quit, a coach whom I met at the swimming pool showed me some tips to run smoothly and efficiently. I also learned from online videos to coordinate the paces of my breathing and running.</p><p>Two months later, I was able to run five kilometers, but I ran only twice a week. After I found out that running could actually reduce my weight, I began to run three times a week, 7.5 kilometers each time. </p><p>I used to hate running, but now I take it as my second lover because it helps me become healthier and lighter. While running, I listen to the radio and admire the beautiful scenery of Jingmei River. What can be more delightful than that? </p>
