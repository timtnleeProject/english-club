<p><strong>May 20, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>Love Circle</em></strong></p><p>“I’m always home alone during the daytime and feel panic when I suffer from the side effects of cancer treatment. I hope to have some patients share their experiences to help me get through it.” This is one of the most common demands we heard from patients and so we decided to start a companion project last year. So far, our 16 companion volunteers have serviced nine cases, seven patients. Yue-shou was one of the beneficiaries of such a project, and her changes surprised us more than any other’s.</p><p>In the past four years, Yue-shou, a cancer patient, has lost her elder sister, father, younger brother and mother successively. She felt extremely lonely, refused to receive any cancer treatment, and had no will to live. Seeing her constantly depressed and weeping, her worried cousin sought us for help. </p><p>Before volunteers provided companion service, it was my job to interview Yue-shou at her place to find out her family background, her economic condition, and her needs. To provide more efficient help, however, I did it on the phone a few times and then started the first service right away together with two other volunteers. In our first meeting, I saw a tall, heavy woman who seemed eager to say something, but only cried like a little girl. She disbelieved in any hope for the future. Though living with her son, she felt isolated. I encouraged her to attend our newly opened classes named “Journey of Breast Cancer” after she had her surgery. </p><p>In the first few classes, she sat at the corner and kept silent. But gradually she managed to share with all participants the onset of depression when she was diagnosed with breast cancer and her recovery from it with volunteers’ help. Surprisingly, she joined our volunteer group to help other patients via a counseling hotline. Furthermore, she registered for the second-year companion volunteer training project. By the end of this year, she will have become a companion volunteer.</p><p>As a supervisor of the counseling hotline as well as the two programs — “Journey of Breast Cancer” and “Companion Service,” I’m surprised to discover and proud to claim that a love circle has been formed: Patients who are serviced by our counseling hotline, companion programs, and self-growth classes eventually join us and become volunteers themselves who shall service other patients.  </p>
