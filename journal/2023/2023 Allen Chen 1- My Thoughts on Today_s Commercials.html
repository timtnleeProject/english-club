<p><strong>Feb. 26, 2023</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Thoughts on Today’s Commercials</em></strong></p><p>Nowadays, commercials are seen not just on TV; they also appear in social media and streaming services such as facebook and youtube. As more and more people do business and shop on the Internet, online commercials become increasingly important in redirecting potential customers to the shopping websites. As a result, most people find it annoying to be bombarded with various commercials every day. However, since commercials cannot be completely avoided, there are several ways we can adjust ourselves in order to appreciate them.</p><p>The first way is for us to think of commercials as little pieces of artwork. Most commercials are trying to deliver some selling points within a limited duration, but not all of them succeed in catching people’s eyes. If watching a commercial involves an eye-pleasing process, we definitely can think of it as a piece of art to enjoy.</p><p>The second way we can adjust ourselves is to take advantage of commercials and be inspired by their creativity. Some commercials use very creative ways to attract consumers or use very dramatic ways to impress viewers. We can definitely learn something if we spend some time figuring out its filming methods or strategies.</p><p>Next time when a commercial pops up on your computer or TV, don’t rush to switch it off. Instead, give yourself a chance and watch it for a moment. It’s very likely for you to feel disappointed, but even more likely, you may be surprised that a commercial can actually help you learn about a good product, and that a commercial itself can be a good product.</p>
