<p><strong>Feb. 28, 2023        </strong></p><p><strong><em>The Newly Launched AI Chatbot    </em></strong></p><p>In our recent family gatherings, the topic we talked about the most was ChatGPT—the AI product that has gone viral in just a few months. ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot designed by Open AI. The number of its users has been rocketing up to more than 100 million since it was launched in November 2022. Due to such an astonishing growing speed, even Google is said to worry about being replaced by it.</p><p>Basically, you can ask ChatGPT all kinds of questions, and it will give you a well- organized specific response. Furthermore, it can write a poem, an article, or even computer programs on the theme you specify. My family were curious about how knowledgeable it could be, and so we asked it to explain how different and similar are the thoughts of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. To our surprise, it answered in a decent essay with clear and systematic explanations.</p><p>However, it would also drop the ball sometimes. When we made it translate into English the famous lines of Lao Tzu “飄風不終朝, 驟雨不終日,” the first reply we got was “The wind never stops breezing, and the rain never stops pouring.” Obviously, that was not the original idea of Lao Tzu. The chatbot apologized for the mistake and asked us in humility to give more clues or a different interpretation. We then explained to the chatbot that “終” could be used as a verb to mean “to end” in other contexts, but it was used as an adjective to mean “entire” in these lines. Thus, it revised the previous translation into “The breeze never ends the entire morning, and the rain never ends the entire day.” At that moment, we all laughed and reached a conclusion: ChatGPT certainly has much room for improvement, at least in Chinese.</p><p>All in all,  the revolutionary technology of the AI-powered conversations tools may be considered perfect for business use or for fun, but it should be noted that strictest legal constraints must be placed on the abuse of such technology. Once the AI products are controlled by people with bad intentions, a tragic outcome becomes inevitable: humans will eventually destroy themselves.</p>
