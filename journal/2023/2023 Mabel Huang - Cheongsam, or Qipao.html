<p><strong>Sep. 1, 2023</strong></p><p><strong><em>Cheongsam, or Qipao</em></strong></p><p>Cheongsam, commonly known as<em> qipao</em>, is a kind of female clothing, a close-fitting dress with high neck and slit skirt. </p><p>Today, by chance, I watched a LINE video about cheongsam. It was a very long video with a Chinese metropolitan city as its backdrop. (Is it Shanghai or Beijing?) I assumed the video was designed to show how ladies should dress up and behave on various occasions when they show up in cheongsam. </p><p>There are, of course, some elements required to match the elegant images of ladies wearing <em>qipao</em>. Applying powder on your face and putting on lipstick are basic steps. On the other hand, wearing earrings, a bracelet and a ring will definitely bring out the salient features of cheongsam dress.  </p><p>As to how a lady in <em>qipao</em> should behave to keep up with her elegant image, below are a few scenarios displayed in the video: </p><ol><li>Four ladies walking hand in hand are trying to cross a threshold while entering an ancient mansion. In their high heels, they avoid stepping right on the threshold; instead, they go sideways. They raise the left leg straight forward across the threshold, switch the center of gravity to the left foot, then bring the right leg over, and continue walking and facing the front. </li><li>Two ladies in cheongsam are greeting two acquaintances they run into on the street. They know it's inappropriate to say hello with  a handshake, a cheek kiss, a hug, or a “Give Me Five.” Instead, they put on a smile, hold their two hands near the waistline, with the right hand palm overlapping the other, slightly bend their knees, and quickly keep their head up posture again.   </li><li>A lady is trying to pick up a paper folding hand fan dropped onto the floor. She makes sure not to bend her waist with her head down to pick it up.  Instead, she pulls her right leg to the back of the left one, bends her knees to almost a squatting position, and snags the fan.  </li></ol><p>Other scenarios include ladies in cheongsam stepping down a train with a briefcase or luggage, chatting while taking a walk in the park, or just window shopping on the streets.  </p><p>Watching this video reminds me of my past encounters with <em>qipao</em>.  My first impression of the <em>qipao</em> comes from a family photo of my parents and siblings. My mother was wearing a sleeveless <em>qipao</em> with her hair up in a bun. Looking at the black-and-white photo, I cannot recall what color the dress was, but the embroidered little circles can be seen all over the dress. The traditional Chinese style dress was totally forgotten until I was to attend the celebration party for the 180th anniversary of the German company I worked for. The party was held at the then Hilton Hotel, just opposite the Taipei Train Station. The company was generous enough to provide a  NT$2,000 allowance to each female employee to cover the expense of a tailor-made <em>qipao</em> for the evening party. I wondered how the German expatriate President would come up with such an idea. My guess was that he truly loved the elegant style  of the mandarin dress.  Up till today, the image of middle-aged finance managers wearing beautiful <em>qipaos</em> of various designs walking around in the office premises is still vivid and alive in my mind.  </p><p>After working three years in the German office, I left it for another job in an American company. It happened that the American expatriate G.M. married a woman from Nimpo, the second largest city in China’s Zhejiang Province. He would often raise his thumb, saying, “Nimpo Woman, Number One!” I understood what he meant, for I was often intrigued by the fact that one of my colleagues, the Office Manager, wore a<em> qipao</em> to the office almost every day. Her <em>qipaos</em> were all so beautiful— some in plain colors, some with exquisite flower imprints, and many with expensive quality fabrics. Her father-in-law owned a renowned construction company in Shanghai, adjacent to Zhejiang Province. I remember she said that all her beautiful dresses were bought by her husband during business trips to Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. </p><p>After I left that American company, I worked in a Swiss firm. Since then, I have never seen  anyone wearing a <em>qipao</em> in the office, for a party, or for a wedding banquet. </p><p>Just a few days before my elder son’s engagement and wedding ceremony, his mother-in-law told me that she would wear a <em>qipao</em> for the important occasion. To match her choice, I rushed to the Sogo Zhongxiao department store and picked up two <em>qipao</em> dresses from Londee (龍笛) specialty store — one for the engagement ceremony and the other for the wedding. When we were up on the stage alongside the newly wed couple, the ceremony master playfully commented that all the three men on stage (the bridegroom, his father, and his father-in-law) had one thing in common — they all liked pretty women. </p><p>This is my encounter with <em>qipao</em>. What about yours?</p>
