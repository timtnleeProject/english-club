<p><strong>July 31, 2023</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Pros and Cons of Being a Breast Cancer Survivor</em></strong></p><p>It has been over 21 years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It’s been so long that I seem to have forgotten the pain of losing my left breast and undergoing chemotherapy, but once I recall my memory, it will all come back clearly as if it had only happened yesterday. </p><p>Such tearful memories were triggered when I began to re-take volunteer work at the Craniofacial Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital early this year. While I was on the shuttle bus to Lin-Ko, the familiar sceneries viewed through the window brought me back to 28 years ago when I worked at the center as a volunteer, then without breast cancer. I wondered if the tragedy that befell me would have been avoided, had I led a life of a different style — no answers popping in, only tears streaming down. I was so sad that I burst into tears and let it out all the way to Lin-Ko. Right after I hopped on another shuttle bus to Taoyuan branch of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, I quickly dried my tears and decided to write down the pros and cons of being a breast cancer patient, which I thought might help uplift me whenever I felt trapped by the painful memories.</p><p> </p><p>I must say the  greatest misfortune about breast cancer was losing my breast and suffering from chemotherapy. I had to wear an artificial breast for the rest of my life and could never put on low-cut tops again. It’s especially embarrassing when I swam, for there was no way for me to hide my flat chest . What’s worse, my left hand could not take any injection for treatment or blood pressure test. Once when I needed to be hospitalized, I could only use my right hand or one of my legs for intravenous injection  or vital sign checks. Last December when I was hospitalized, they could not find any blood vessels in my right hand, so they tried to inject my leg. They tried very hard but in vain. Lying there, I was in so much pain that I hardly said a word. </p><p>Despite the above-mentioned disadvantages, I got countless benefits for being a cancer patient. It was like getting free access to almost all activities related to breast cancer. As I worked for the Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance (TBCA), I was given opportunities to attend international conferences in Beijing, Vietnam, Myanmar and Germany for sharing with patients and experts abroad the TBCA’s achievements in serving Taiwan’s patients. Among these trips abroad, the most unforgettable one would be the flight in business class to Frankfurt, Germany. During the eight hours up in the air, I was too excited to sleep — I ate all the food and drank all the beverages to my satisfaction. Besides promoting the TBCA in the international conferences, I also joined some press conferences to advocate for patients’ interests and attended some TV programs to explain the importance of breast cancer treatment. All these undertakings made me sense the value and meaning of life.</p><p>Of all the advantages, the most rewarding one for me would be being friends with thousands of patients around the globe, especially those who worked with me as volunteers over a decade. We are still friends now and get together occasionally. No matter what difficulties I meet, they will always share my burdens. </p><p>Recently I took a volunteer training class that taught me to talk to my own breast, either the breast prosthesis or the remaining healthy one. From doing it, I realized that the breast I had lost was an angel on the other side of the world. She had to leave to give me the opportunity to contribute to this side of the world. Someday when I fulfill all my duties here, we shall reunite.</p>
