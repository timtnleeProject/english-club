<p><strong>Apr. 4, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>An Annoying Behavior</em></strong></p><p>I had been so used to talking loudly even in public places that I was never aware of the problems such a habit might cause others, not until last Sunday.</p><p>After sending my daughters to join a reading club last Sunday morning, my husband and I went to a coffee shop. The quiet atmosphere there made me feel like writing an English journal. People kept coming in while I was writing. A three-girl group chose to sit next to us. From the moment they began to talk, the tranquility in the shop vanished totally, and their annoyingly high-pitched voice made it difficult for me to concentrate. I gave my husband a look saying silently, “Why do they speak so loud?” I turned my face to those girls to give them a strange look which forced them to lower their voice, but only for less than five minutes.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought flitted through my mind: I was just like them, always speaking loud regardless of people around. It was the first time I felt embarrassed for my behavior and got to know how loud voices in public areas might upset people. I did not look at them again as I felt grateful that they had given me a chance for self-introspection. I told myself that I would constantly remind myself not to do the same wrong ever again while I stay in public areas.</p>
