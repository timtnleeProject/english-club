<p><strong>April 24</strong></p><p><strong><em>Costco Tour</em></strong></p><p>Speaking of the international supermarket, maybe the Sogo Department Store or the 101 Building will pop out of your mind instantly. They are very popular department stores for sure, but the prices of the same goods they sell are usually 10 to 20 percent higher. The imported products are so expensive that average people can't afford them.</p><p>	</p><p>Costco is different from those department stores. It provides many high quality goods from abroad but at lower prices, such as fruits, seafood, clothes, furniture, daily necessities and all kinds of things you can think of.</p><p>	</p><p>The salmon imported from Canada by airplane was packed 20 centimeters by 10 centimeters. I bought it home, and cut it into 8 or more pieces, packed them separately, and put them in the refrigerator. I did the same thing with the very fresh ribs of pork or beef. Other products like apples, pears and grapes are all fresh and cost much less than those in other supermarkets. I purchase there about once every two or three months. </p><p>In order to promote products, Costco sets up a number of stands beside which people are invited to taste sample foods like bread with sesame sauce; good smelling fried salmon mixed with onion, pepper and oil; slices of apple; small cups of juice, herbal tea, etc. Although we always need to wait in a long line, everyone thinks it is worth it.</p><p>	</p><p>The thing I like the best is going there to have a lot of juicy, delicious but lower-priced beef rolls for dinner. If you bring it home, the juice in the roll will disappear. So you’d better enjoy it on the scene.</p><p>	</p><p>It’s really fun to take a Costco tour.</p>
