<p><strong>June 18, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Stoic Acceptance</em></strong></p><p>My daughter’s friend, Ruth, 40 now, has had a boyfriend for over four years. One day she got a letter from him, saying because he was not good enough to match her, they could never be a perfect couple. He blessed her to find a good man for life-long companionship. Ruth was so stunned and in pain and could not do anything except crying. Her friends, including my daughter, came up with lots of plans in hope of teaching the heartbreaking fellow a lesson. In the end, she had no choice but to accept this cruel fact. </p><p>	</p><p>One of my good friends had a prestigious and beautiful daughter, Amy, who, after graduating from Taipei First Girl Senior High and then Architecture Department of Cheng-Kung University, got a master degree from Seattle University. Needless to say, Amy would have a splendid future. Being critical, she always thought her bosses were either not creative or too demanding. In the end, she chose to be a boss herself. For the sake of my good friend, I hired her to design and decorate my old house in Jiu-Kang Street. But after that, for a long time, she was not able to get new clients. She stayed at home very often and asked her mother for money, leading a very unhappy life.</p><p>	</p><p>To my surprise, Amy ignored many people’s advice and insisted on opening a restaurant in order to make bigger money. Although her mother fiercely opposed her wild plan, she still lent Amy money. Because of the scarcity of customers, Amy closed her business only half a year later. Worst of all, a year ago, she underwent a surgery cutting off one of her ovaries, and recently the doctor found that Amy got breast cancer. Now her poor mother has no choice but to take care of and support her for the rest of her whole life.</p><p>	</p><p>Robert, a favorite son of one of my second cousins, was talented in sports and music. With his good appearance and wide knowledge in arts, Robert always had girlfriends around him during his growth though he did not receive higher education. His mother was very nice and capable but resented those who were unfaithful to their friends or spouse. While Robert was warned against cheating any of his girls, he always reminded his mother that young guys actually knew things better than the older ones. A few months ago, one of his girlfriends got pregnant, but he refused to marry her. As a result, his parents were forced to deal with the shame themselves, bringing the girl to the hospital to get an abortion.</p><p>	</p><p>That’s life. Sometimes you actually have no choice but to accept what you have to face. </p>
