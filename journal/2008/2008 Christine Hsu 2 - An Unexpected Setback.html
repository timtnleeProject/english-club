<p><strong>Mar. 21, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>An Unexpected Setback</em></strong></p><p>Why would a responsible person like him do such an unreasonable thing as to ignore his promise just for satisfying his wife’s not so urgent demand?</p><p>On the third Sunday of every month, I will lead some Tzu Chi Foreign Language Team members to a folks’ home at the outskirts of Xin-Dian. About ten days before we go, the participants will mail me to register so that I can arrange the cars for them. To host the activity is not difficult, but to have enough cars to take all participants there is always a problem, so I do appreciate those who are able and willing to give us a free ride. </p><p>Last Saturday afternoon, I got a call from one of the volunteer drivers who said that his wife would need his car to go to a lake near the folks’ home on Sunday. When I asked him if he had forgotten the three passengers he needed to take, his answer made me speechless: “I cannot turn my wife down. If you cannot find another car, those volunteers can come along and sit with my dog.” </p><p>Without his help the activity was still successful and we got a very wonderful sharing during lunch time. I overcame this unexpected setback, but I did think it was wrong to sacrifice public interest for personal happiness. If I were that volunteer, I would take my family to the lake either before or after that day instead to avoid causing problems to the activity host.</p>
