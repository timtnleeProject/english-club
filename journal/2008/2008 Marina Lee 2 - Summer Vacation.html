<p><strong>Sep. 5, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Summer Vacation</em></strong></p><p>To avoid boredom during pregnancy, I had planned several activities for the summer such as attending yoga and swimming classes, staying with my father in Hyaline, taking trips to Lanyon and Osaka, and taking the General English Proficiency Test of intermediate level.</p><p>	</p><p>As it turned out, yoga and swimming classes were good for an expectant mother like me. Besides doing regular exercises, I kept a healthy diet, so until now I had not suffered symptoms of pregnancy. As for attending the GEPT test, it was a good way to push me to keep reading English. The registration fee was expensive, though.</p><p>	</p><p>I regarded the trip to Osaka as my last backpack trip before my children grow up, and so I carefully planned the travel schedule for the 7-day vacation in Japan. As my belly was getting bigger and bigger, all of my friends started worrying about me. “Are you sure you can travel for so long? Can you take the airplane? Can you walk for a long distance in Kyoto?” In early August, my husband and I set off for the journey.</p><p>	</p><p>This trip did not disappoint me. We only spent sixty thousand dollars altogether, and the best part is we traveled the routes as planned and tasted great dishes as desired. My favorite scenic spot is the “Philosophy Road,” along a stream with maples on its both sides; several artists were engaged in their work with serenity. My favorite food is Minutia Pork Chop; its crust is crispy and its meat soft, fresh and juicy. My favorite dessert is Yuzhih Jinshih. Yuzhih is originally a place for Matcha, and Jinshih means golden bean, now replaced by red bean. I strongly recommend backpackers to travel in Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe even if they can speak neither English nor Japanese. This trip gave me the greatest fun this summer vacation.</p>
