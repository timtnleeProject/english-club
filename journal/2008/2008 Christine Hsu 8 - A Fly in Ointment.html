<p><strong>Oct. 3, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Fly in the Ointment</em></strong></p><p>Strong Typhoon JANGINE did not ruin my mood to join the 12<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance (TBCA), but the following three things which were like a fly in the ointment.  </p><p>One day before the convention, the leader of my patient group told me that one of our members, Mei, would not stay overnight because her roommate snores badly. Without a second thought, I told my leader that I could switch the hotel room with Mei. But she still chose to leave on the first night regardless of other members’ feelings and my helpfulness.</p><p>This was not the only thing that upset me on the first night. We, philanthropists of TBCA were supposed to rehearse for the following night’s performance, but it was postponed to the following morning simply because some senior philanthropist said it was too harsh for us to rehearse after a long-day activity and they needed more time to talk with members of their patient group. I was so angry that an instant response flew out my mouth, “How can you two make the decision without asking others? I’m looking to attending tomorrow’s class.” They answered me, “Being a philanthropic, you have to sacrifice.” I felt wronged as I already put on the uniform, chosen by them, which was even too old for my mother. Why should I sacrifice my favorite class just for their benefits?</p><p>The anger was not gone but buried in my heart. It exploded in the next morning while we were having breakfast. One of the convention participants asked me if fried cabbage was the only vegetarian dish. I turned back to confirm with the waitress working in the counter. She did not step out, but pointed to those pickles and replied rudely, “Those are all vegetarian food.” What an unacceptable answer! But I calmed myself and tenderly asked that if we could have one more dish of vegetable. She unwillingly said, “We only offer fried cabbage for breakfast.” This was beyond my endurance. I decided to report her to the hotel manager so I asked for her name. She was finally aware of the serious situation and walked out the counter and tried to make up, but I insisted to have her name. While our talk was deadlocked, two philanthropism came to comfort and remind me that I was not only a customer, but also one of the hosts of the convention so it was better not to reveal my anger in front of the public. </p><p>“Getting angry is actually punishing us for the mistakes of others.” How can I forget Master Chen Yen’s teaching and be out of control? It was because Mei’s rejection of my goodwill and the waitress’s rudeness that I embarrassed and humiliated myself. I felt deeply regretful and hoped that I would never forget this lesson again.</p>
