<p><strong>Oct. 15, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>After the Summer Was Gone</em></strong></p><p>On a fine day, the sun shone as bright as that in Greece, which urged me to take you away from home, to drive you around. You looked into the distance and said nothing while the vehicle sped on the empty road. As reflected in the rear mirror of the car, the white clouds were floating around in the blue sky. After the vacation, the crowd dispersed and left their rubbish everywhere along the desolate beach, but the sea waves did not stop roaring. And I seem to hear the roaring of mind too. When you picked a seashell up and listened to it closely, did you hear “I love you so” said in my mind? “It’s getting late. We should leave,” you said. After I drove you home, alone I walked to the parking lot, all hidden in the darkness of night, and stood among the vehicles for stars to discover the tears of mine sparkling from the rear mirror of a car.</p><p>	</p><p>After you had gone away, after you and summer had both left, winter and I together revisited the amusement park that you and I had enjoyed before, stepping on the shoe prints that we had left and walking through the trails that we had passed. Once when you and I rode on the Ferris-wheel, you held my hand tightly, nestled your head on my shoulder, and said, “Do remember each moment of our life.” Now, the amusement park was almost entirely covered by dense fog. Its facilities, all rusted, though still greeting the sunlight bravely, would soon stop functioning.</p><p>	</p><p>Walking out of the amusement park, I wrapped myself with my overcoat, and rubbed my palms that you used to hold so tightly to generate a glow. I realized that as the amusement park becomes old-fashioned, so does our love get rusted, with its details forgotten bit by bit. Luckily, I have saved the best memories that record the most impressive moments of our life—the sunlight, the blue sky, the sea waves, and the parking lot in summer; the dense fog, the amusement park, and your nestling up to me in winter. These unforgettable moments are to be carefully collected and preserved so as to sustain us in the rest of our life.</p>
