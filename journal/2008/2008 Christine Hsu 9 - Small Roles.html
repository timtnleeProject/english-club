<p><strong>Sep. 19, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Small Roles</em></strong></p><p>“Last week, in the closing ceremony of Tzu Chi International Medical Association convention, when I saw doctors from 18 countries walking onto the stage one by one and forming into a shape of Chinese character which stands for ‘people,’ I felt so touched!! Most of their faces can’t be seen, but without any of them, the character cannot be perfectly shaped.” Via satellite, one of our volunteers in Hualien shared with us at a volunteer assembly this Monday morning. Master Cheng Yen responded to her, “That’s true, so there is no need to always stand in the front; each person in his position is equally important.” After the meeting was over, it was time for us to begin one day of volunteer work at the Taipei Branch of Tzu Chi General Hospital. Seeing hundreds of volunteers move out of the conference room in one single line, I felt deeply touched by the fact that though most of them were assigned a rather ‘insignificant’ task, all of them were excited and felt honored to serve in the hospital.</p><p>Those ‘insignificant’ tasks include greeting and serving beside the escalators, putting out the number sign for patients at the registry, and opening taxi’s doors for patients at the front door of the hospital. All of them stood from morning to afternoon except lunch time. If the hospital was a big stage, they were minor but essential players to help doctors and nurses achieve perfection in performance.</p><p>I stopped working as a volunteer at the hospital two years ago because I thought it was boring. During the two years, I mostly worked as a leader of volunteers and shouldered heavy responsibilities, the pressure of which drove me to try some easier tasks. Gradually, I found that to be a small potato was not as bad as I had thought; I even enjoyed being it sometimes. That was why I started the hospital volunteer work again. Through playing various small roles, I realized their underlying importance.</p>
