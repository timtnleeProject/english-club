<p><strong>Mar. 6, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Leadership</em></strong></p><p>“Thanks for your great help. It is so good to have you.” </p><p>This is what the leader of Tzu Chi foundation’s 3-in-1 team always writes to me soon after I send her an activity report. In the team, some volunteers record, take pictures or make a film for each activity. I usually take the writing assignment. As I always finished the record the day right after the activity, the leader got a good impression of me though I only joined this team for three months. And she, too, made a strong impression on me: She was totally different from the leader of Tzu Chi Foreign Language Team (FLT), who never said good words to us but criticized our work simply because the result did not meet his expectation or we did it without following his rules.</p><p>At the very beginning when I just joined Tzu Chi Foundation, I felt those senior volunteers’ compliments were not sincere as they complimented all volunteers no matter if they did well or not. But the longer I worked with them, the deeper I felt that good words were very powerful, which not only gave volunteers confidence but also encouraged them to do more. The FLT leader, on the contrary, felt that he was giving us the rare opportunity to do good deeds, so he never appreciated our contribution. In the past four years, I got used to his poor leadership and unpleasant manners, but I was still seriously hurt when he badly criticized the FLT activity record of 2007, for which I spent over 300 hours collecting pictures, writing the captions and editing all pages. No matter if the record was good or bad, I thought I deserved at least a thank-you note, not such a harsh criticism. His bad words not only broke my heart but also made me realize that he would never be the kind of leader I should follow.</p><p>From these two totally different leaders, I learned that to be a good leader, one should always show his appreciation of his followers. Complimenting others is like sprinkling perfume, and so when we say good words to others, we smell good, too.</p>
