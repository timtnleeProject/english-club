<p><strong>Nov. 4, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Familiarity and Unfamiliarity</em></strong></p><p>I went to Nanjing W. Road to fix my car last week. This is the area where I took my first job after graduation from university. I looked around while waiting. The city view reminded me of my past life.</p><p>	</p><p>I was not born in Taipei, but I’ve been living in this city for my whole life. I got married and had my own family in Taipei. The city is special to me in that it witnessed and recorded my prime years of life. I remembered when I came to Taipei for the first time, I always got lost when I went outside. When night came, I always missed my family in my hometown. After marriage, I was still afraid of the darkness of the night. Everything looked unfamiliar to me in darkness. So, I always turned on the lights in every room for the whole night. </p><p>	</p><p>Now, I am familiar with Taipei City. I can search the map in my brain immediately when I want to go somewhere. On the contrary, I get lost easily in my hometown—Hsinchu, especially now with many newly built roads and my parents moving into an area where I am a total stranger.</p><p>	</p><p>Time increases familiarity while distance increases unfamiliarity. As roads to home change, so does the definition of “home.” </p>
