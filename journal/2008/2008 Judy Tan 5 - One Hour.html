<p><strong>Sep. 4, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>	One Hour</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>	</em></strong></p><p>What could happen in one hour? At about 8 pm, I met two policemen who stopped me because I made a right turn at the red traffic light. I never thought that I would have such bad luck to get caught by the policemen in the dark and quiet corner. I was too astonished to find my driver’s license and I tried to explain why I was in such a hurry at the same time. It was amazing they just let me go when they knew that I was hurrying up to buy a chocolate cake for my daughter’s birthday.</p><p>Too panicked to cope with the sudden misfortune-turning-into-luck, I unthinkingly laid down the motorcycle trunk cap before I found that my bag and my key were both in the trunk. I was stunned there. I could not move. My money, credit card, ID card, and cell phone were all in my bag, and my motorcycle was locked up. I could not leave my motorcycle behind because all my property was inside the trunk. What should I do? There were two taxi drivers chatting beside the road. Should I ask them for help? I knew I had no choice.</p><p>The two taxi drivers were very enthusiastic in helping me. They found tools trying their best for almost half an hour to open the trunk but in vain. I then waved my hand to stop a motorcyclist for help. After he found out my situation, he just left without saying a word. The two kind taxi drivers discussed and decided one of them would take me to find a repair technician to unlock my motorcycle while the other of them stayed to watch my motorcycle for me.</p><p>A few minutes later, we found a technician who was kind enough to follow us to solve my problem. When the other taxi driver saw me, he said, “The motorcyclist had called up another technician to help. The technician was here and left this name card.” How nice these people are! The two taxi drivers, the motorcyclist and the technician were all my benefactors. Thank God for sending them to help me. It was 9 pm already. I must hurry up to buy the chocolate cake for my daughter. What a night! I went through terror and thankfulness within just one hour.</p>
