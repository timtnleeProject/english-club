<p><strong>Sep. 12, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A World of Love</em></strong></p><p>In Tzu Chi Xin-Dian Hospital, there are two groups of volunteers: one group work during daytime; the other stay at the hospital for four days. Volunteers take four different kinds of work--serving patients, preparing tea and meal boxes for volunteers, cooking for construction workers, and receiving visitors. Last Thursday, I registered to receive visitors.</p><p>I used to sneer at this work as I had seen volunteer guides in volunteers’ lounge receiving no group visitors. To avoid the same, I consulted a senior volunteer experienced in guiding visitors. She said that being a guide, we should not just stand still and wait, but move around to<em> </em>find the guests. “We are more like a movable poster.” I kept her words in mind and decided to be an active guide.</p><p>I was assigned to an exhibition room with twenty posters displayed to introduce 16 different non-government organizations. Besides the Red-Cross and Tzu Chi Foundation, there were many small groups of volunteers contributing themselves to helping poor people, starving kids, endangered species, and so on. I could not wait to tell people about their great love. When Mr. Lee walked to a poster near the front door, I automatically approached him and gave him a brief introduction as he was in a hurry to see his friend in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Before he left, he told me that he had always felt touched by what Tzu Chi volunteers did around the world; but it was because of my surprisingly heartwarming guidance that he personally experienced how enthusiastic Tzu Chi volunteers were. Due to his encouraging words, I thought I made a successful step in being “a movable poster.”</p><p>The following visitor made my day even more meaningful. An elderly woman walking with a cane prayed sincerely in front of a Buddha made by lazurite. I walked to her with a tender smile and described how the Buddha gently touched the earth and sprinkled the holy water to purify human beings. Then, I explained patiently how the volunteers of the 16 non-government organizations worked hard for people in need. In return, she told me that as a donating member of Tzu Chi Foundation, she donated NT$900 per month but left herself only NT$600 for daily expenses. Despite her disabled right hand and left leg, she tried to help people instead of indulging herself in self-pity. What a living Bodhisattvas!</p><p>I was glad that I had been doing my job in the exhibition room instead of idling in the volunteers’ lounge. Through receiving one or two visitors, I learned more than receiving a group of visitors as I had better interactions with them: I not only got to share with people great stories of admirable volunteers but was constantly inspired by their feedback. </p>
