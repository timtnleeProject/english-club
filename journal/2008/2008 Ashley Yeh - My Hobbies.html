<p><strong>Dec. 12, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Hobbies</em></strong></p><p>I have several hobbies that make my life happy and healthy. The first one is Chinese martial arts. I have practiced it for about eight years. Every Sunday afternoon, I go to a Tai Chi club in my church. There we played Tai Chi along with beautiful music. Though being sweaty and exhausted, everyone feels great each time.</p><p>	</p><p>My second hobby is keeping pets. I have two dogs, one parrot, and a school of fish. By taking care of them, I get a chance to love and play. I play tug-of-war with my dogs with a rag. I often challenge my parrot with skillful whistling. Every time I watch my fish swimming, I feel peaceful.</p><p>	</p><p>The third one: learning English. I have been listening to English channels for several years. I have absorbed a lot of new knowledge by learning English too. I feel these are indeed great hobbies to keep. They have made my life wonderful.</p>
