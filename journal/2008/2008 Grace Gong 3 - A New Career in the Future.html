<p><strong>Nov. 4, 008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A New Career in the Future</em></strong></p><p>If I have a chance to start a new career in my future life, I would like to be a Yoga teacher. I took a year’s Yoga class at a gym. The Yoga teacher was an Indian, who taught the traditional Indian Yoga, the most important part of which is learning how to breathe properly in meditation. The Yoga teacher always looked neat and calm with his long black curly hair and very fit muscles. He was popular among his students and enjoyed a great reputation because of his professional skills and his kindness. A vegetarian, he always shared his health food concepts with gym members.  He told us the best way to stay healthy is to eat simple food because “You will become what you eat,” he said. Besides organic foods, he upheld the natural lifestyle. He seldom turned on the air conditioner at home unless there were visitors, nor did he use cell phones or computers because the electrons would cause electromagnetism that did harm to us.  </p><p>The second Yoga teacher I had was a young girl introduced by one of my friends. She taught new Yoga which requires concentrating on body operation. Each pose’s completion demands repeated exercises of your body to meet the utmost of your expectation. No wonder she appeared so good looking and elegant, and her figure was slender and perfectly fit. She looked bright and smiled like the winter sun, and she was friendly to everybody. She took good care of e8ver student of hers and analyzed each posture’s effect on the body in her patient teaching. I had gained so much from her being one of her students.</p><p>The two Yoga teachers practice Yoga in different ways but both emphasize environmental protection, advocate for natural food, and lead a self-disciplined and simple life of calmness and love, free from anger, stress, and violent emotion. Obviously they have not only pretty looks but also pure minds.  </p><p>I have been learning Yoga for more than five years. Practicing Yoga relaxes my body, loosens my muscle, improves my health, and helps develop my will power.  Also, Yoga has become a trendy, fashionable exercise. If I could be a Yoga teacher, I could work out every day to stay young and make money to gain wealth at the same time. I would become an attractive, confident, and powerful woman. Isn’t it great?</p>
