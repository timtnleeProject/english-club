<p><strong>Sep.25, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Letter to the Instructor of Our English Club</em></strong></p><p>Dear Jennifer,</p><p>It is my honor to join the English study group here. I like the way of your teaching, and I enjoy sharing experiences and opinions with you and other classmates.</p><p>You may find that I don’t talk much and I seldom write because I am always afraid of making mistakes just like most Chinese. I lack the courage to open my mouth or write sentences. Although I had noticed since a few years ago that there was an English study group at the Mu-Cha Branch of Taipei City Library, I did not take action to join it because I had once read some articles posted on the library’s bulletin board, and found them all seemed to be writings in complicated grammar and sentence structure. I was too ashamed of my own poor spoken and written English, which has stopped me many times from making any move. At the end of this August, as my younger daughter became a junior high student, I found I had much more time for myself. I thought it was time to expose myself in an English-speaking environment instead of just staying at home and memorizing some easy vocabulary. So I finally showed up in the English club and I found that all my classmates studied hard. It will surely push me to study harder.</p><p>My girls tried to make fun of me after finding out that I joined the English study group. They said in a surprised tone, “You, a housewife, dare to join an English club? Wow!” I understand that my English may be only equal to that of a native kindergartener, but it is better than never starting. </p><p>With the arrival of 9/28 Teacher’s Day, I would like to send my best regards with best wishes to you.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Grace</p>
