<p><strong>Mar. 28, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A New Task</em></strong></p><p>Near the end of last year, volunteers of the breast cancer group in Wan Fang Hospital recommended me to Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance (TBCA) for one of its philanthropic candidates. As I was not one of its members, I needed to pay NT$800 to get the qualification for nomination, because of which I almost gave up as I did not know what good we could get from it.</p><p>After attending its anniversary ceremony on February 24 at Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH), I felt glad that I made the right decision. Besides electing new philanthropism, it also gave awards to excellent volunteers recommended by various breast cancer groups. From the annual report, I got to know more about TBCA and was amazed at the record they kept: Compared with those done by volunteers of Tzu Chi Foundation, the content of their report was highly organized and abundant. And their presentation was systematic in their use of both printed documents and computer files. I was greatly impressed and felt honored to be able to work with such an efficient team in the near future.</p><p>I also noticed some ladies with pink sweaters busy with reception and preparing desserts. They were volunteers of TSGH’s breast cancer group. Their leader was one of TBCA’s philanthropists. After the convention, we had a dinner gathering with these volunteers and all the new philanthropy of TBCA. The leader of TSGH’s breast cancer group made a speech to compliment their volunteers and gave them an enveloped thank-you note. Every volunteer also expressed their gratitude to the leader. I did admire her leadership and enjoyed the harmonious atmosphere.</p><p>I liked TBCA further more after joining a 2-day trip in early March, during which I got the chance to get to know each one of those philanthropists. Most of them were leaders of their groups. Though they were from different parts of Taiwan, they were equally enthusiastic, selfless and kind. There were only 20-some philanthropists and five employees in TBCA, but they got lots of plans for the year 2008 with a great vision to help breast cancer patients. I knew for sure this was an organization which deserved my dedication and that I should take those lovely women as my role models.</p>
