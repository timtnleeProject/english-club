<p><strong>Sep. 17, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Going to the Millet’s Exhibition</em></strong></p><p>The first time I went to see the Millet’s Exhibition with my friend, it was so crowded that I had to wait in line across the street. Finally we decided to see Millet’s exhibition another time. Although we live in Taipei, we seldom visit the Botanical Garden. Attracted by the tall big trees, we took a walk there. It was so magnificent a view that nearly hundreds of chubby and active squirrels were jumping under the shades.</p><p>	</p><p>Afterwards, we visited a Ching Dynasty construction nearby named <em>bu zheng si</em>布政司, meaning a place where the government officials worked in the old time. Built with wood, many parts of it were damaged. Despite its loss of the past glory, it was evaluated as one of the ancient remains.</p><p>	</p><p>The second time when I went to the exhibition, there was still a long waiting line. We had no choice but to give it up and go to the Botanical Garden stead. Fortunately, it was big enough for us to spend another day. In the rainforest area, it was amazing to see a great variety of trees. Included in the palm tree category are broad-leave, thin-leave, Malaysia, Indonesia, giant, small, and many among others.    </p><p>	</p><p>Next to the lotus flower pond is a literary plants area, which collected many rare plants mentioned in ancient Chinese poems. The authorities of the Garden tagged each special plant with a poem and gave it a name drawn from the poem. For example, the plant bulruah got the name 蒹蕸, drawn from a poem from the Book of Songs, 蒹蕸蒼蒼，白鷺為霜，所謂伊人，在水一方; dogwood was named 茱萸, drawn from a poem by Du Fu of Tang Dynasty — 遙知兄弟登高處，遍插茱萸少一人. Reading those poems seemed to have removed me temporarily away from the busy and noisy world.</p><p>	</p><p>Eventually, on August 15, we went to the museum and waited in line for a few minutes before we got to view the exhibit. When we stood in front of the Millet’s pictures, we found a sad society in the France of the 1800s. Millet used deep dark colors to draw the working people. A young girl was herding sheep in the dim light of dusk. A woman hung her head down and clasped both her hands, and a man lowered his head a little and held his hat in front of his stomach, both praying seriously on the vast field under the setting sun.</p><p>	</p><p>The masterpiece “Picking the Ear of Grains” made a strong contrast between the rich and the poor. The three poor women picked the grains left on the field by the landlord. In the distance, many carriages that belonged to the rich men were piled with grains while near them workers were working hard. Through this picture Millet sent his government a message of social injustice. If we just purchased souvenirs like the luxurious silk shawls, environmental bags or fancy postcards, all with Millet’s paintings on them, without pondering on the truth he was revealing to us, we are putting both ourselves and the artist into shame.</p>
