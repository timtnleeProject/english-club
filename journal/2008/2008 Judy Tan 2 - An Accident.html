<p><strong>June 11, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>An Accident</em></strong></p><p>	</p><p>It really frustrated me when I opened my eyes and found that I could not eat anything except liquid food. I had fallen down from my motorcycle and my chin was sewed over 10 stitches and my TMJ (顳顎關節) was broken. I was frightened to learn that I could not grip my left side teeth after the doctor finished sewing my chin in the emergency room of National Taiwan University Hospital. When I told the doctor my condition, she asked me to have an X-ray immediately. The X-ray showed there was nothing wrong with my teeth, but she called the dentist to double-check anyhow.</p><p>The dentist tried hard to bend my face to the right but it was useless. He decided to take another X-ray, so we went through the long passage to the dentistry to find if my TMJ was broken. Then he asked another doctor to tell me that I must take a 6-month treatment to fix my mouth. I was stunned there, only able to ask one stupid question: “Can I eat?” The answer was certainly, “NO.” “Can I drink?” “Yes, you must drink at least four bottles of Nutrition Food a day, and you could drink anything you like.” Now, how am I going to survive from this? I just could do no better than either a one-year-old or an 80-year-old. For the following seven weeks, I have eaten no solid food.</p><p>	</p><p>My dear angel doctor asked me to go to the hospital once a week. I never liked going to the hospital until this serious accident, because I knew the more times I went there the better my health would become. It was delightful to go to see my doctor every time. It was extremely depressing to be able to eat nothing at all, but I prayed and thanked God that even though I suffered, I could still walk around, go to my office and do the housework as usual.</p><p>	</p><p>Eventually my dear angel doctor told me, “I’ll unfasten your rubber bend from your teeth today.” After seven weeks’ drinking and smelling, I could finally eat. I bought a cake and devoured it ferociously while waiting at the bus stop.</p><p>	</p><p>I ate fish porridge, oyster noodles and fruit. I ate, ate and ate since I finally could eat. Actually I cannot open my mouth wide, so I still have to rehabilitate my mouth. Although it is painful when I open my mouth wider, I feel so happy that I am getting better.</p><p>People say that one never knows what will happen in the next second. I perfectly understand the truth of that saying now. What do we want in life? Sometimes we seem to want too much. To eat and to sleep well is quite enough for me. I feel it most strongly after this terrible accident.</p>
