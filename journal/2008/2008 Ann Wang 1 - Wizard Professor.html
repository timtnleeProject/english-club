<p><strong>Apr. 22, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Wizard Professor</em></strong></p><p>It's amazing how certain little incidents may haunt a person throughout his life. My younger daughter told me a story one of her teachers had shared with the whole class, a story that happened when he was still a sophomore of law school at National Taiwan University. This school has been famous for its academic freedom, which urges students to take the initiative in study, and so roll-calls have seldom been taken there.</p><p>	</p><p>As commonly acknowledged, the subjects of the law are often too abstract to comprehend. Except the especially talented ones, as my daughter’s teacher recalled, most law students usually had no idea about what the teachers talked about until they became seniors who matured with time. After all, knowledge and learning are accumulative. So, making “collaborative reports” became an important tradition for all to follow: students took turns to tape-record teachers’ lectures and then transcribed them into documents to be shared among the class. Unfortunately, it also offered a few students good opportunities to skip the classes. My daughter’s teacher was one of them.</p><p>	</p><p>As the final test was to be held, most students were as nervous as ants on the hot-pot, since only one test was given in a semester and there was no chance of make-up for those who failed. My daughter’s teacher panicked and desperately demanded whoever he knew in the dormitory to help out. Most of his classmates did their best to help him despite their own poor comprehension.</p><p>	</p><p>On the day of the test, after the professor gave out the papers, everyone opened their law dictionary on the table and buried their heads in the papers to answer the questions quickly. During the test, the professor walked up and down on the aisles, and then he stopped behind him for a while and wondered why this student’s law dictionary was kept so clean, without any annotations. Two hours later, the test was finally finished. He found that he worked up a great sweat which wetted his entire back. In the following days after the test, he was disappointed in himself, felt uneasy even when eating and sleeping, and anticipated the troubles he would soon get into.</p><p>	</p><p>A few more days later, one of his classmates claimed loudly in the dormitory that they had all been cheated by a classmate too mean to make friends with, who got an incredibly high 95 in the test of the most difficult subject, the highest grade ever in the class. He was startled and thought it a mistake, so he ran as fast as he could to check the bulletin; however, it was exactly as reported. The professor had played a great joke on him. He suffered guilty conscience but had no chance to explain it to his classmates—no one believed in his innocence. He was determined to work hard from then on. And yes, indeed, he actually did it during the following semester. He read the group reports repeatedly and researched secondary materials; he familiarized himself with all theories the teacher had lectured on, measuring one theory against another. </p><p>Soon, the final test was coming again. This time he did the papers confidently and carefully, thinking he must be able to get a good grade this time as he deserved it. But, again he was startled when he saw he got a low 65. It was totally unacceptable to him. So, he went to his professor and demanded an explanation with a voice of protest. The professor said with great calm and serenity, “Well, you see, the first time I read your paper, I could see a drowning man as you tried to show sharp ideas to seek survival and then made mistakes consistently. But the second time, I saw nothing more than an excellent parrot.”</p>
