<p><strong>Aug. 19, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Summer Vacation</em></strong></p><p>◎An opportunity</p><p>In the beginning of summer vacation, my life underwent a very big change. Now I no longer work for the company I had been serving for three years; instead I am maintaining the website for Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance (TBCA). </p><p>When my ex-boss told me that he would temporarily close down in Taiwan, I did not feel shocked, but it surprised me that just 10 days later our leader of TBCA philanthropism asked me to maintain the organization’s website. I had no confidence at all until they showed me the administration website, which was almost the same as the one I used during the previous employment. “Is this the window God opens for me?” I thought it was, so I took up this new job and regarded it as a great opportunity to learn more. So far, the workload was more than what they had informed me of and the salary was much lesser than I got from my previous job. The big advantage was that I could work at home. My working experiences told me I must record everything I did and the time I spent on the job. I thought it would be easier for all philanthropism to know this was not an easy job. Before I asked for a reasonable salary, I had to do more to get their acknowledgement of my contribution.</p><p>◎A new challenge</p><p>In early June, I was assigned to receive 200 overseas Chinese students who would visit Tzu Chi Xin-Dian hospital in late June. But only a few members of the Tzu Chi Foreign Language Team (FLT) got experience in introducing the hospital so I thought it was a must to hold a training class for FLT members. </p><p>While deciding to do it, I only got myself and Master Cheng Yen’s words, “As long as you do the right thing, you will get people to follow you.” With her encouragement, I invited some senior FLT volunteers to work together to realize the plan. To my great surprise, more than 40 volunteers registered for the training class.</p><p>To save volunteers’ time, we set up the class on the same day the visitors arrived. First of all, we introduced volunteers to the hospital in Chinese and then they joined the 200-visitor group to view the hospital with our English introduction so that all volunteers could learn both in Chinese and English. After the class, some volunteers registered for next reception work around a month later. Though we spent a great deal of time planning it and preparing the guide books, all our efforts paid off when we witnessed that our plan was actually working.</p><p>The following one month, we got the chance to introduce our Humanitarian Center for another group of overseas Chinese students. With excellent team work, we did a good job there and all our volunteers were grateful to get the chance to introduce Tzu Chi to foreign students.</p><p>No matter working for TBCA or training FLT members, I felt that once I vow to do something, I got the power to accomplish it, and that if it was the right thing, I would always get volunteers’ help in time.</p>
