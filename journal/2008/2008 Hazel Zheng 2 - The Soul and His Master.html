<p><strong>May 5, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Soul and His Master</em></strong></p><p>One day the Soul poured out a sad story to his friends. “NO . . . ,” a trembling voice screeched in the air and deep sorrow filled the valley.</p><p>	</p><p>The day was a nasty day. Everything seemed to worsen. In the stillness of night, my master walked with slow and heavy steps toward the cliff. I begged him, “Please don’t act silly,” but he insisted that he must die. He exclaimed, “It’s too painful!”</p><p>I knew his spirit was burdened with a heavy depression impossible to be released. As I sank into deep thinking, I remembered the pleasurable time we had in the past. Once he was a bright, intelligent and praiseworthy boy. I tried to talk to him calmly. “How foolish you are,” I said. “You have so much property and fame to maintain a worthy life. How can you throw it away so easily?”</p><p>“What an impassive soul,” the Master answered feebly. “I have been prey to loneliness since my childhood. I could no longer endure playing the role of genius to satisfy my mother’s vanity, who always shows off my cleverness. All adults envy her for having a genius son like me, but all fellows have left me alone, and I became friendless though I remain an obedient son.</p><p>“I doubt if I ever understand the purpose of living. Why do I feel compelled to follow unreasonable orders? Why am I always breathing hard? The situation is getting worse and worse. Am I a robot? I asked myself sometimes. Then, I got myself a best friend—DRUGS. When my mother discovered my irregular behavior, she cried, shouted and screamed but it was all too late. </p><p>“That’s why I am here. My dear Soul, even you couldn’t deliver me from extreme sufferings, could you? I am sorry that you must part from my body. Thank you for accompanying me for the last 15 years. I wish you would get yourself a more cheerful master. Goodbye, my Soul,” he said calmly. Then his body flew in the air of the bleak valley. “My Master jumped off the cliff to commit a suicide,” the Soul said.</p><p>“NO . . . ,” the Soul moaned and moaned with pathetic echoes floating in the empty air.  </p>
