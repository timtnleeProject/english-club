<p><strong>May 31, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>	Tour Guide License	</em></strong></p><p>Today, I attended the oral English test for my tour guide license. I was nervous because I was not confident in my English. Before the test, I did prepare questions to ask myself as a practice but I knew it was not enough. I had no idea what kind of questions would be asked. So, I told myself: Just take it easy and be yourself.</p><p>There are two sessions for the English tour guide oral: One in the morning and the other at noon. I took the former one. There were totally 968 persons who passed the written test. Every examinee must wait in the lounge for his turn, and then be led to the test room by the proctor. After I entered the test room, I watched the video camera and said my name and number. Then, I introduced myself for three to five minutes. </p><p>“Good morning. I am very glad to be here. My name is Ching-Fang Lee. I graduated from Aletheia University, and my major is tourism. After I graduated, I worked as a tour guide at a travel agency for almost five years. Then I found I needed to improve myself, so I quit the job and went to the States to learn English for one year. After I came back to Taiwan, I got a chance to be a vocational high school teacher and served there for three years.”</p><p>One of the two interviewers started to ask, “How would you promote Taiwan’s tourism if you were a government official?” </p><p>	</p><p>“I will use brochures or Powerpoint files to show them.”</p><p>	</p><p>“And what will you put in the PPT file?” the same person asked again.</p><p>	</p><p>“I will include Taiwan’s natural, cultural and other abundant resources.”</p><p>	</p><p>“What are ‘other resources’ in Taiwan?”</p><p>	</p><p>“We have six national parks, 13 aboriginal tribes, 319 counties, distinct four seasons, friendly people, and convenient transportations.”<br />	</p><p>“What did you tell your students about the important things to be a tour guide?”</p><p>	</p><p>“English proficiency, so they can give accurate and precise interpretation to visitors. Equally important is having an enthusiastic heart and creativity. Always create surprises to leave a good impression upon the visitors.”<br />	</p><p>“What kind of activities would you arrange for your visitor?”</p><p>	</p><p>“You meant activities on the bus?”</p><p>	</p><p>“He meant some special activities, like Yanshui Beehive Rockets Festival,” another interviewer added.</p><p>	</p><p>“It was dangerous to attend the Yanshui Beehive Rockets Festival. I know it because I have been there one time. I think if visitors want to attend it, they must know the possible risk and the safety measure.”</p><p>	</p><p>“So, what would you do instead?”</p><p>	</p><p>“I will arrange a road trip along our northeast coast to spot dolphins or whales, or a folk art tour of Ying-Ge Ceramics Museum or San-Hsia Temple.”</p><p>“So you will never recommend such a festival to your visitor?”<br /></p><p>“No!”</p><p>Ten minutes were gone and my oral test was over.</p><p>After I came out from the Examination Yuan, I was feeling regretful instead of being nervous. I didn’t know why I answered “No” to the last question. Oh, my goodness! But nothing could be done now. The only thing I can do is keep learning English hard; in the hope that one day I can overcome my fear and pass the English test.  </p>
