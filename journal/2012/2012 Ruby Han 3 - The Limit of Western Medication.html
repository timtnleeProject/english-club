<p><strong>Dec. 7, 2012</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Limit of Western Medication</em></strong></p><p>Near the end of last year, I had been hospitalized for 10 days because of serious asthma. So strangely, after coming back home, I sweated on my upper body and even nearly had my clothes moistened at midnight. It was so uncomfortable that I went to see my pulmonologist. Believe it or not, he actually suggested that I go and get Chinese medication. So did the Doctor of Division of Family Medicine at National Taiwan University Hospital. Eventually, I had no choice but to go to see the Doctor of Chinese Medicine at Wan-Fang Hospital. After taking some Chinese medicine for half a month, this annoying problem got away indeed.</p><p>     </p><p>Around decades ago, my right elbow got hurt after I played tennis for too long. The doctor told me that besides taking medicine, I should receive some physical therapies and use my left hand to do everything to reduce the burden of my right hand. I was forbidden to play tennis during the period of treatment. In order to get back to the court to play balls soon, I not only comply with the doctor's directions about using my hands but also went to the hospital regularly for rehabilitations such as electrotherapy, water therapy and shortwave therapy. Two hours a time and three times a week over three months, I had not missed any of them.</p><p>     </p><p>Unfortunately, after the treatment during the whole summer vacation, I didn’t feel well with my right hand at all. What’s worse, my left hand got into trouble too. Now I would feel the obscure pain if I tried to lift a glass of water or a book with either of my hands.</p><p>     </p><p>I really didn’t know what to do next. One of my friends suggested that I try the “hand-moving” exercise which is one of the Chinese martial arts aimed at sustaining health and curing diseases. Although it only requires swinging hands back and forth continuously over ten times, it effectively promotes blood circulation and rides off diseases. At the beginning, I just tried without too much hope. Unexpectedly, I really felt better and better day after day. Several months later, my two hands nearly recovered completely.</p><p>     </p><p>As I recall it, the rehabilitation process for my elbows in the hospital is like a terrible nightmare. I am so grateful for my friend and this simple “hand-moving” exercise from Chinese Kung-fu. I don’t know what might have happened without them. It’s all God’s blessing. Now whenever I feel uncomfortable about my body parts, especially my hands, I’ll swing them back and forth 500 times. And it usually takes half a month for me to have the problem resolved.</p><p>     </p><p>Chinese medicine has been ignored for a long time in Taiwan. Big hospitals such as National Taiwan University Hospital and Guo-tai Hospital never set up a Department of Chinese Medicine. In fact, some herbal medicine really is effective in curing some special diseases. For example, if you want to stop breastfeeding, you just put half a kilogram of malt with five bowls of water, boil them until only two bowls of the mixture is left, and drink it once a day and for several days. Then you no longer suffer the painful breast swelling. But if you go to a western doctor when you have a breast swelling problem, he would give you a weaned shot or some anti-inflammatory stuff, which does not release the breast swelling but causes a lot of breast masses around the breast instead. It’s not less painful than giving birth to a baby. I had had those horrible experiences when I had my son and daughter delivered. So there is a limit to western medicine. Taiwan’s medical professionals should research Chinese medicine and even combine it with western medicine to create more effective medicine without side effects to benefit patients. Let’s hope this great day comes soon.</p>
