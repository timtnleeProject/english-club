<p><strong>Oct. 10, 2012</strong></p><p><strong><em>Follow Your Passion, My Daughter</em></strong></p><p>Over a decade ago, after the University Entrance Examination, my daughter knew she might end up studying at the Department of Industrial Design of Hua-Fan University. She was upset and figured that she couldn’t do well there so she intended to give it up. We, her parents, both acknowledged that industrial design was useful and fashionable everywhere so we encouraged her to give it a try. Finally, she accepted our suggestion, though not without difficulty, to study at Hua-Fan.</p><p>     </p><p>But one or two months later, she told us she was capable of neither designing nor drawing beautiful pictures, and that she was afraid she must compete with others all the time if she engaged herself in it as a career. That would be a huge pressure in life. We persuaded her to try again but she told us she preferred to be a teacher of little kids.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, my daughter agreed to talk with one counselor in my school. The day she came to my school happened to be the school’s anniversary. Compared with the girl students there that were full of vitality, noise and laughter, my daughter seemed completely exhausted, both physically and mentally. I felt heartache deep down. After their talk, the counselor told me, “There are few young people who know themselves well and follow their passion. She is one of them, and you should take pride in her.” At the end of fall semester, my daughter dropped out of school temporarily in order to prepare for taking the horrible University Entrance Examination again. </p><p>Now she goes to her school for work in just 15 minutes. Compared with those who work far away from home and under great pressure, she is extremely satisfied and happy with her job and her life.</p>
