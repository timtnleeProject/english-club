<p><strong>Sep. 7, 2012</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Bird and Two Strangers</em></strong></p><p>In 1949, the 17-year-old Gu Bou-jen followed the Kuomintang government to Taiwan from Zhe-jiang Province (浙江) of China. At that time he was too young a soldier to know that he would never be able to go back to the mainland again.</p><p>	</p><p>Retired from the army, Gu worked as an apprentice at a small noodle restaurant. After a few years’ hard work, he began to run his own restaurant and earn lots of money, but his life changed after he got married in his late 50s. His wife cheated on him, drained all his savings, and ran away from home. Since then, Grandpa Gu lived alone.</p><p>	</p><p>Every afternoon, he would stroll to a nearby park, sitting on a wooden chair, smoking his pipe and watching the white smoke floating in the air. This was a luxurious moment he greatly enjoyed.</p><p>	</p><p>Ten years ago Antony, a painting teacher at a kindergarten in California, met Julia from Taiwan, and they fell in love at first sight. Soon, Antony married Julia and moved to Taiwan. Unfortunately, after five years, Julia got cancer and died suddenly. It took years for the heartbroken Antony to get his life back. Now he paints for tourists in a park every day.</p><p>	</p><p>When the first spring thunder rang in early March, Antony casually caught a glimpse of the gray-haired Grandpa Gu, who was smoking in a wooden chair, his eyes gazing at the far distance. Since then, Grandpa Gu has turned to be one of Antony’s favorite sights. He kept observing him for 10 days and judged that Grandpa Gu was just as lonesome as he. One day, he brought along his pet, a bird which he had kept for over six months, and walked to Grandpa Gu. In fluent Chinese, Antony told Grandpa Gu that he would give him the little bird as a gift. Grandpa Gu slowly raised his head and gave the stranger a brief look. Antony carefully took the bird out from the cage and put it in Grandpa Gu’s hand. Grandpa Gu stared at the bird without moving his eyeballs.</p><p>	</p><p>After that, Grandpa Gu was never alone; he always had the bird accompany him.</p><p>NOTE: I accidently found two pictures on the Internet which inspired me to make up this story.</p>
