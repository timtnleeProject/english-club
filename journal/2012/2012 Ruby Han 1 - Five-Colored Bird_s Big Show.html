<p><strong>Aug. 27, 2012</strong></p><p><strong><em>Five-Colored Bird’s Big Show</em></strong></p><p>Going through the 2-28 Park in early June, I was surprised to find many high-class cameras, commonly called Big Cannon, set up around a tree cordoned off by a long piece of yellow cloth. The warnings on the cloth given by the Taipei City Government cautioned pedestrians against interrupting the Five-Colored Bird which was nursing its baby in its nest on the tree. How interesting.</p><p>One of the bird-watchers pointed me at a hole on the tree in which the bird lived. All of us just waited quietly. Maybe 10 minutes later, all the people quickly went to their cameras already set up, and aimed at the hole to shoot pictures quickly because the bird flew back and stood right at the door of its nest. Less than two minutes later, the bird flew and left all fans regretful with their mouths open.</p><p>I too like five-colored birds very much. Whenever I heard their special sound, I would always stop immediately and look up the tree to search for them. But I always ended up finding nothing and going away with great disappointment. Right now, I was so happy that I could see this colorful, wonderful bird so clearly, just about three meters away.</p><p>To grasp all possible opportunities of taking pictures of the five-colored bird, those bird fans usually got to the park around 6 a.m. with their lunch box and a bottle of water. One of them said, “Bird photography is better than fishing. The exciting moment of catching a fish is also the time for it to die. We, however, don’t bother the bird but just watch it fly in and out of its home freely.”</p><p>On one hot day, I got there again. In addition to those male fans, a woman wearing a hat with wide brim joined the group’s picture-taking. When all the people ran to their cameras and started taking pictures, to their surprise, the bird stayed before its door for about only a few seconds and then entered its hole. The man who was previously chatting with me said disappointedly, “We must be fully concentrated; otherwise, we’ll miss the precious shots.” I was so sorry for him. Afterwards, I just stood by and stared at the tree quietly. I prayed for the bird to come out of its home soon to make up for the loss I had caused the man.</p><p>At the end of July, a strong typhoon Sula swept northern Taiwan. I was deeply worried about the bird’s safety: What did he eat? Would its home be drowned in such a heavy rainy storm? I had been anxious about whether my dear bird was in danger. Thank God, not only did the bird remain healthy but her three babies were also safely born in a row during the serious typhoon period. It was estimated that over 100 bird fans brought their supper with them to observe and take pictures of the bird’s activities, such as finding food, flying around, feeding babies, and sleeping.</p><p>     </p><p>The baby birds were grown enough to learn to fly. One of the baby birds flew up on the tree but failed to stand steadily and so fell in the pond under the tree. All the fans there rushed to the rescue of the almost drowned baby bird and then sent him to his home in a great bush before they could take their breath and get relieved.</p><p>One of the bird fans told me that a young baby bird finally flew away safely at 7 a.m. on the 27<sup>th</sup> of August. It’s so lucky that the long but wonderful great show of five-colored birds and Taipei people eventually ended happily, with the empty hole of the hollow tree left in the wind but the grand visual banquet imprinted in my brain. I love Taipei and its passionate and romantic people.</p>
