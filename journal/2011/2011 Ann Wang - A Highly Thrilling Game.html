<p><strong>Mar. 10, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Highly Thrilling Game</em></strong></p><p>“My dear audience, don’t feel confused about what you see on TV. It’s true! Taiwan’s top tennis player Lu Yan-xun has already won two sets against Andy Roddick in the tiebreak. Now the competition is coming to the fourth set. The first set was 4-6. Roddick downs two sets in a row. It is really a marvelous game. It is difficult for anyone to face the strongest serve and shot seed player, Roddick, who had won through to the final for three times before this game, not to mention Lu, who was much weaker in offense and relied mostly on his tenacious belief and faith to continue the game and give his best shot. Now the game has come to deuce. Roddick gives a strong defense at the moment . . . . Lu is now facing the crisis of two break points . . . .” The broadcaster said with nervousness and thrill.</p><p>	</p><p>During the fierce battle, the audience was cheering for Roddick. Whenever there was a tiebreak, a sense of anxiety prevailed among the audience, and I was constantly troubled and worried for Lu more than I enjoyed the delightful surprises created by him. Facing such a master of serve and shot as Roddick, who is specialized in the grass turf, Lu showed incredibly strong determination and will. I suspected that he must have worked hard on constructing a healthy mentality.</p><p>	</p><p>Sudden cheerfulness and sudden disappointment rotated to drive the spectators crazy. It’s easy to tell their mixed feelings from their expressions. They clapped enthusiastically for Roddick’s great play, rooting for the hero they admired, but at the same time they were gentlemen enough to give Lu polite applause. It’s really interesting to see how their emotion shifted along with the battle, how they might jump to their feet with great excitement at one moment, but stare dumbfounded with mouth wide open in extreme disappointment at the next moment.  </p>
