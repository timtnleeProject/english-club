<p><strong>Sep. 23, 2011	</strong></p><p><strong><em>How Lucky I Am</em></strong></p><p>After swimming regularly in the early morning for over ten years, I thought my swimming skill was good enough. But my self-confidence was challenged after I met a coach a few months ago. Little did I expect that his enthusiastic help would totally change the way I swam and improve my swim skill a lot.</p><p><strong>	</strong></p><p>“Do you feel that your legs and hands don’t work together?” One day a coach said to me when I was just about to leave the swimming pool. I stared at him with a confused look. He asked me to do free-style, but with only my hands. I did as he told and found that my legs would swing to the right and left when I paddled my right and left hand. It was at that moment I became that all along I had had my legs kick straight no matter which side I paddled.</p><p>	</p><p>Besides my legs, I also used the wrong muscles to paddle, which caused the sore on my arms and shoulders. Using the method he showed me, I swam more quickly and easily. I did not feel tired even though I swam longer than before. The coach said that using the correct way to swim not only saved energy, but also shaped figures. And I had done it wrong and missed such advantages.</p><p>	</p><p>The coach always gave me one tip or two when I went swimming. And so I would expect to try his method and always could not wait for the next morning to come. This month I began to modify my butterfly stroke. I improved after practicing a few days. As I used too much energy and incorrectly, I could only do butterfly strokes for 50 meters, but now I did not feel sore for my weak waist even after I had swum more than 100 meters. How wonderful is it that I could do butterfly strokes in such a relaxed way!</p><p>	</p><p>This coach helped not only me but also other swimmers in the same pool. I sometimes wondered whether he came not to exercise but to share his great skills with others. How lucky I was to have met such a nice and skillful swimming coach.</p>
