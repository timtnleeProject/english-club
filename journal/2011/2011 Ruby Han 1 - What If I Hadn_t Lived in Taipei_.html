<p><strong>Apr. 7, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>What If I Hadn’t Lived in Taipei?</em></strong></p><p>My daughter’s baby son got a cold when he was just two months old. His parents took him to see a doctor at a clinic near their house. The doctor gave them no medicine but said instead, “The baby has immunity from his mother, and will get well soon. Don't worry.” A few days later, the baby son kept coughing and became even more seriously ill.</p><p>	</p><p>My daughter brought him to Zhongshan Hospital where she had given birth to her baby son. Unexpectedly, after checking the baby’s chest, the doctor suggested my daughter bring the baby as soon as possible to a larger hospital which had a special department to treat babies below six months of age.</p><p>	</p><p>About 9 p.m., my daughter and her husband went to Guo Tai Hospital. The doctor asked them to leave the baby at the baby observation room for a few days in order to give him shots and medicines, and pull his sputum with a special machine for little babies because babies couldn’t spit sputum themselves. What if we hadn’t lived in Taipei? I couldn’t imagine what would have happened to their baby with no medicine to cure him, and no hospital to treat him properly and in time.</p><p>	</p><p>In addition to providing a good cure, the best of all, the hospital charged them only NT$2,300 though he had been hospitalized for seven days—as the expense was mostly covered by the all-people health insurance.</p><p>	A few months ago, I found that one of my birds, Xiao Ding Ding couldn’t fly but just walked around the floor. Gradually, he ate less, slept more and became weaker and weaker. I gave him the most nutritious food and bought some vitamin powder to strengthen him as suggested by a pet storekeeper. To keep him warm, I put his cage under a soft light. A few days later he still stayed in his cage all day long. One afternoon he could hardly stand and even fell down to the bottom of the cage from the pole he always stood on.</p><p>	</p><p>I was worried that Xiao Ding Ding might die on that cold night if he stayed at home. I had no choice but to take him to the San Diego animal hospital, which served birds, turtles and amphibious animals, on Luo-si-fu Road in Taipei. The vet measured my little bird’s weight first, and then checked up his stool. Parasites were found in its body. Besides feeding him some medicine, the vet gave him a shot and made him put on an oxygen mask for a while. At the end, they asked me to leave my Xiao Ding Ding at the hospital for his safety’s sake.</p><p>	</p><p>When I visited my Xiao Ding Ding the next day, I saw a huge yellow boa constrictor in a big basket on the floor and a huge turtle in a big bag on a man’s shoulder. This is a special and famous hospital that treats many unusual pets. All doctors there are from the department of veterinary medicine at National Taiwan University. Three days later, I brought my bird back home. It cost me NT$3,300 for the bird to get his medical treatment. Again, I wonder what would have become of my dear bird if I hadn’t lived in Taipei.</p><p>	</p><p>The convenient public transportation system, the quality medical system, and the variety of delicious food make Taipei a wonderful place to live in. We could enjoy walking, jogging, or riding a bike on the streets, in the parks, or along the riverbank with beautiful flowers blossoming on both sides. I’m so lucky to be a citizen of Taipei. </p>
