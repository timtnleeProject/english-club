<p><strong>Feb. 11, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Year-End Party</em></strong></p><p>As in last year’s year-end party, I could hardly tell how the food tasted as we played games during dinner time and all games were more difficult than last year’s. To win the prize, I almost gave all my strength and burned out my brain but still failed for most games.</p><p>The first game was “crazy radish squatting.” When I was a kid, we called ourselves white radish or red radish, and chanted “white radish squatting” three times with our knees bending, and then called other players to do it. If you called the wrong name, you would be out. At the party the host changed “radish” to movie stars, such as Leonardo Di Caprio, Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, and so on. As I was not familiar with those movie stars, I was quickly out of the first round. Little did I know the second round was three times more difficult. We used cities as our names, like Buenos Aires, Lichtenstein. “That’s impossible for me to remember. I can’t even read it!” All of us screamed at the host! It was a disaster for me to get the name Papua New Guinea because it was comparatively easier to read so everyone called my name.  </p><p>Swiftly finishing salad and appetizer, we began the second game immediately. This was more torturous. We played in pairs. Assigned to a subject, we took turns to sing a song which included the subject in the lyrics. When I got the first subject, sea or water, my brain went blank and hardly thought of a single song. After a bitter competition, surprisingly, my team won the prize. </p><p>We finished our main courses and desserts along with playing the other two games. The intense competition made the food dull. I even got no time to view the splendid scene from the 85th floor of Taipei 101 Building. What a waste!</p><p>Compared with mine, my husband’s year-end party was much more fun. Most employees were dressed up to match the theme of “nation-founding heroes”for their company name was Chien-Kuo (建國), which literally means founding a nation. There were people dressed as army, navy or air force officers. I also saw some people wearing camouflage uniforms. The host skillfully arranged all the programs, such as singing, fashion show and dancing, to entertain all the participants. Best of all, I could actually enjoy the dinner all the way through without being interrupted.</p><p>Besides the food and harmonious atmosphere, I also admire my husband’s boss, Mr. De. He has not only run a successful business, but also supported Chung-Yi Orphanage for years. About 20 kids from that orphanage attended the party. They expressed their gratitude by performing a dance and presenting him thank-you cards. I like him also because he was a vegetarian. I feel blessed for my husband to work for such a kind and generous person.</p>
