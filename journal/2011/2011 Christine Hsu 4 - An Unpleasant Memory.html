<p><strong>Sep. 9, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>An Unpleasant Memory</em></strong></p><p>I had never joined such a Tzu Chi activity which was so exhausting that I would never even want to think about it again.</p><p>	</p><p>Last August, more than 30,000 Tzu Chi volunteers took part in 24 performances of musical adaptation “Water Repentance” at Kaohsiung, Taipei, Taichung and Chang-hua respectively. I joined two shows at Taipei dome on Aug. 12 and 14. All were very successful. Most audiences felt shocked and amazed to see 2016 volunteers perform like one person and some audiences felt so touched by every single lyric we sang that they could not stop crying.</p><p>	</p><p>This show was adapted from a real story about Master Wu-Da. Before he became a master, he had killed an innocent person. The victim tried to revenge himself throughout generations of lives, but all were in vain. Finally, he got a chance to fulfill his vow after ten lives’ time. When Wu-Da suddenly realized that he suffered from the human-face tumor because he had killed an innocent, he repented for his wrongdoing and decided to write the sutra “Water Repentance” in order to warn himself and others against evil doings. Through performing this sutra, I learned that once we did wrong things, we would make negative karma which would follow us life after life for no one could escape from the law of karma. Despite the precious lesson I gained, I suffered a great deal during the past four months of endless practices and rehearsals.</p><p>In March, volunteers began to register for this show, but not me, who was intimidated by the expected tight schedule for practicing. Besides practicing sign-language, all performers needed to read the sutra once a week. I chose simply to learn sign-language with them once a week and had a very joyful time, but it did not last for long. After one month, a volunteer asked me to replace her on stage because she could hardly bend her knees. Without the heart to refuse her sincere request, I reluctantly took over her role.</p><p>	</p><p>In Taipei, we had 2016 volunteers for each show, performing on four stages. The 504 volunteers to be working on the same stage as a team actually came from three different districts of Taipei. Besides practicing twice a week in Mu-cha, we had to practice with another 400 volunteers at Tzu Chi Ban-chiao chapter once a month, but the nightmare was just beginning. Two months before the formal performance, we practiced almost three times a week. Moreover, we went to Ban-chiao during weekends and stayed there for a whole day. The part that I found hardest to endure was that they changed the schedule again and again and forced us to fully cooperate. The unpredictable schedule messed my life and deprived me of my freedom. During that period of </p><p>time, my life became even more miserable than the time when I undertook chemotherapy.</p><p>	</p><p>After a long-time waiting, the day Aug. 12 finally arrived. I felt extremely excited and could not stop smiling in my heart during the 2-hour show, knowing that I would get back to my normal life right after I finished it. I did love this musical adaptation, but the whole process generated strong negative effects on me and took away all my enthusiasm for Tzu Chi.  </p>
