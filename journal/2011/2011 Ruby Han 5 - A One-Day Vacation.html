<p><strong>Nov. 13, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>A One-Day Vacation</em></strong></p><p>September 30, 2011, Friday, 2:30 pm, we got to the County Grange for a one-day vacation in Yilan County. With the help of the GPS, we got there around 4:00 smoothly. Once we arrived at the destination, a graceful, deep Big Ten bob gallery popped out in front of us. A large number of strings of blue and white flowers immediately drove all summer heat away.</p><p>	</p><p>After we put simple luggage down in our room surrounded by two violet trees in full bloom and a large swing bench in the little courtyard, we enjoyed a free afternoon coffee with a fresh-baked muffin. Ascending on the view-platform at dusk, we saw mountains with white clouds and several houses dotted on the expansive serene green field.</p><p>	</p><p>The owner of the B&amp;B is a romantic and versatile person who majored in architecture in Da Tong Technical College. The elegant building stands in the garden with various kinds of trees such as chestnuts, pears, coffee trees, perfume trees, and many among others. Ducks, geese, and fish swam in the pool, and even the wild geese flew here to accompany them by chance. Many hammocks were hanging between the trees. A 3,000-ping park is full of many interesting things. At night, delicate lights decorated pavilions, the river bank, roads and buildings. One of the interesting constructions is a “dulling pavilion.” Maybe the owner expected the visitors to slow down their steps and think of nothing or just have a daydream.</p><p>	</p><p>The next morning, after taking a look around the garden and finding a little brick kiln burned with a red bladder, we had breakfast with another traveler. Unexpectedly, the people sitting by our side were from Hong Kong. They had only four days for a vacation but stayed here for two nights. They said they were tired of the hustle and bustle of traveling and preferred to enjoy a more relaxing country lifestyle. The five of them rented a taxi from the airport, stayed in Taipei for one night, and then drove here directly. They got all necessary information online about Taiwan’s scenic spots, and trusted in the quality of Taiwan’s B&amp;B. That was why they chose here despite the long time spent in traffic.</p><p>	</p><p>About a half hour later, a server informed us that the sweet potato was baked already. They ran to the kiln, took all of them wrapped by tin paper, and invited us to share them. Eating the hot sweet potato, we all had a wonderful time. </p><p>	</p><p>While we were checking out, the boss told us there were many foreigners such as Singaporeans, Japanese, or Hong Kong people who like to stay here. Many mainland Chinese even came here to learn about how to manage a B&amp;B. Yes, the idea of traveling has been changed: the leisure style of B&amp;B is hitting the market.</p><p>	</p><p>Besides enjoying a great vacation, I was pleased to find Taiwan was different from the past. Because a lot of people are doing their best in every field including the tourism industry, Taiwan has earned a good reputation around the world. So we shouldn’t look down upon ourselves. If we keep doing well, I believe that the 22<sup>nd</sup> century would belong to us for sure.</p>
