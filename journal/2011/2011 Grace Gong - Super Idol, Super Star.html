<p><strong>June 25, 2011	</strong></p><p><strong><em>Super Idol, Super Star</em></strong></p><p>The Eagles, one of the phenomenal singing sensations, has become my super idol since I fell in love with country rock. </p><p>The Eagles is a famous band. They are the top one in the music world. They produce songs and lyrics on their own. Almost every single song they produced hit the hot list at that time.  The <em>Hotel California</em> is considered to be the most classic and popular of theirs. My favorite one is<em> OL 55, </em>a song about things that happened in the car along the road. Every time I would feel life is just like a journey on a trucker in Detroit when I listen to the song. I love the idea of driving a car home across a desert at sunrise, and maybe, there are some crows flying in the sky waiting to peck my body once my truck breaks down. “OL 55” was a truck model number manufactured by Ford but had nothing to do with time as suggested on the website. Many songs they wrote many years ago are still famous and popular today. Their songs have the magic power to stir up people’s imagination, feelings and memories. The lyrics they created are not just words but beautiful poems, which always resonate with people’s minds. The Eagles, established in 1970, had been struggling for success in the beginning five years. It’s been 35 years now and they are still sitting at the top of the music world.  </p><p>On February 26, 2011, the Eagles gave a concert in Taiwan. I went to the National Gymnastic University in Lin Ko to see their live performance. A friend of mine who is a musical producer had reserved a seat with a perfect view for me so that I could see them clearly. This was my second time seeing my idols in person. They are just the same as they were years before when I first saw them.</p><p>During their performance, they showed their extraordinary stardom-mannerism. Unlike some other singing stars, they never flattered the audience. They fastidiously sang and played to the spectators. I like the way they blended their voices and arranged the vocals. Especially, I love the way they played songs in a cappella (阿卡貝拉). I am fond of them very much not only because of their fantastic music but also their multiple talents. Besides writing and composing music, each member of the band is capable of being a solo, leading vocal and playing the instruments. The very cool thing they do is that they always exchange the roles in charge of playing instruments on stage.  They like to show their music capability by doing this. Also, Don Henley is an activist of environmental protection and has dedicated himself to ecological preservation. Glenn Frey, an outstanding golf player, has once won a PGA championship. Furthermore, with a natural aptitude for acting, he even starred in the TV series <em>Miami Vice</em>. Joe Wash is an internationally known vocational musical producer, as well as a leader of the band of James Gang. Timothy Schmitt is a talented gymnast in parallel bars, and also has a band run by himself in a different style from the Eagles.  With their versatility, they inspired me about what an artist should be like. </p><p>	</p><p>The concert lasted two hours and a half. When it came to the end, they played two more songs as encores. Later, they came out together for curtain calls and the audience gave a standing ovation to show their exhilaration. Then, in a sudden, they disappeared from the stage. The screams and whistles drowned the performance hall. People lingered on without any thought of leaving.  Everybody, I believe, was still enjoying the aftertaste of intoxication.   </p><p>	</p><p>Such a wonderful experience would have been missed by me if C.M. had not been kind enough to give me a ride. He is an aficionado of the Eagles too. It took us two and a half hours to get there due to the serious traffic jam caused by the Eagles’ concert. On the way back home, we agreed with each other that the show was amazingly fantastic, and that we would be proud to say we had been there with the Eagles.</p>
