<p><strong>Apr. 22, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Sad Story</em></strong></p><p>I was sitting on Bus 236. An old and fat woman, with a crutch with four legs, got on the bus. I let out my seat for her. After she sat down, she kept yelling at someone loudly. I wondered if someone she knew had failed to catch the bus, but she said she was shouting at a man in a red shirt standing in the rear part of the bus. Indeed, there was a young person standing there. She then told me, the young man, at 22 now, was her grandson and had hurt his elbow. She was about to take him to see a doctor whose clinic was next to the Mu-zha Post Office. At this time, a young woman went to the young guy and asked him why he did not answer his grandmother and blamed him for his coldness. But the old woman explained that her grandson had been hit on the head at the age of four. That was why he acted a little strange, she said. I was quite amazed by her insistence on protecting her grandson, considering his insufferable attitude.</p><p>	</p><p>An old woman who couldn’t move freely still took care of her young grandson carefully, but what did the young man do? In fact, this kind of story goes on everywhere, every day. What is the meaning of life anyway? Life seems to have left no alternatives for us.</p><p>	</p><p>Do you know a clothes store which sells clothes at NT$50 a piece in the Mu-zha Traditional Market? Due to its low price, many women go there to make a thorough search from the big piles of clothes before they buy some. </p><p>	</p><p>Last Monday afternoon when I got there, to my surprise, an old man and an old woman were standing inside, looking impatient and in pain. I was very angry at the sight, and I went to the shop opposite the clothes store to get two chairs for the two miserable elders to sit on. While I took another look at the store and its surroundings, I found two old women sitting on wheelchairs and doing nothing outside the store. At last, I found I was standing among local women and foreign workers, mostly Philippine or Vietnamese maidservants. </p><p>	</p><p>As a matter of fact, those foreign workers should have taken their ill employers to the park for fresh air. Although they are all on duty, they couldn’t resist the temptation of low-priced clothes. Could you imagine what might happen to those elderly and sick people waiting at this narrow and crowded place for a long time? What if one of the careless customers bumps into them? They might fall down and die. This is a really serious problem. But I have no idea how it may be solved.</p><p>	</p><p>We will all be getting older and older. What those old people are encountering, we’ll meet one day. This is another sad story of human beings.</p>
