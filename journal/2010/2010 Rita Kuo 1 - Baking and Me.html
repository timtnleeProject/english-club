<p><strong>Apr. 10, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Baking and Me</em></strong></p><p>About six years ago, I quitted my job and became a housewife. The major reason for this decision was I wanted to be a full-time mother and enjoy the process of my son’s growing up. But when I really became a full-time mother, I didn’t know what I should do after the boy went to school. I even had no friends, and did not know how to use computers at that time. I thought it was very strange for me to go for a tour when my family was either working or studying. So, reading became one of my favorite hobbies in my daily life, especially recipe books.</p><p>	</p><p>I learned a lot of techniques about cooking from recipe books. I really copied the courses from the recipe books for each dish. Baking was something I had never tried before, but I was so surprised that baking was so easy, and that it was so much fun to make bread or cakes. So I baked bread or cakes of many different styles for my friends to taste. And everyone started asking me how to make this or that. But it was very difficult to tell the exact process without any stuff in hand. So I decided to take photos during the baking process, and then post it on my blog on the internet. In fact, I had learned by myself the computer and digital camera skills for a long time. Now I can show the baking courses very clearly on the web. Sometimes the baked food didn’t taste good, but the photos were perfect, so because of my blog, everyone on the internet thought that I was an excellent baker. Since then, I knew how to kill time when my son was at school.</p><p>	</p><p>Right now, I have three blogs on yahoo, and I have a lot of friends from all over the world. Most of them are women. We shared different experiences about how to be a good mother, how to enjoy life, how to cook, and so on. Some of us make a promise to keep in touch in blogs, and we even vow to get old together.</p><p>	</p><p>I think my blog takes me too much time, much more than baking. But it really is the record of my true life. I still love baking very much. I will never forget how baking has extended my life. And I like to have my house filled with the smell of baking, which, I think, emits a feeling of warmth and makes an ideal home.</p>
