<p><strong>Sep. 24, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Two Interesting Conversations</em></strong></p><p>Imagine a scene where, on the weekend evenings, my husband sits leisurely on the sofa, sipping his tea served after dinner and surfing one after another channel to find something to watch on TV, and I am surrounded by a pile of woolen balls, busily knitting wool into a sweater. It’s a warm moment as well as a comfortable zone of mine. I really enjoy it.</p><p>	</p><p>But, sometimes I am fond of chattering or bothering him during such a noiseless evening, trying to arouse his desires for making a conversation about any topic. Once, I was affected a feminine look and asked him with a lovely voice, “Papa, would you like to help me knit the hem of this sweater? I can teach you.”</p><p>	</p><p>“No, no, no,” he hurriedly blurted. “What if I learn it? Soon it’ll be my job to knit the hem of all the other sweaters.” I nearly fell over laughing. At that moment, I wondered: Where has his sensitive heart and romantic feeling gone? His intuitive reaction let me know that he was too lazy to even utter one more word. By good fortune, I don't really mind his unenthusiastic response. I just like to tease him to not only make myself happy, but also boost a pleasant atmosphere between us, and then liven up our life. </p><p>Besides knitting, I love listening to country music and studying. Speaking of study, I have been engaged in reading the English magazine Studio Classroom since this summer. The main purpose is to improve my vocabulary so that I may avoid the repeated use of the same words in my writing. However, this magazine is a challenge to a slower reader like me. It takes me half a day to immerse myself into a large pool of vocabulary and phrases every day.</p><p>So, if I play mahjong online on weekends, I will feel as if I have committed a criminal act. One day, I couldn’t resist the temptation and started playing it again, with my husband accompanying me by my side to help me win the game. An idea struck me and so I asked him: “Old Pa, why don’t you study English for me while I’m playing mahjong?” He grinned with an expressive smile: his good-looking smile that bared his middle to the third teeth—I’ll never forget this beautiful scene.</p><p>Anyway, among a variety of daily activities, study is one of the most important ones to me at the present time. So, no matter how numerous daily trivialities keep interrupting my learning, I need to do my best. And the first thing I have to do is take the mahjong game out of my computer at once!</p>
