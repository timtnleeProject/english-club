<p><strong>Jan. 17, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Gardening</em></strong></p><p>Lingering on the rooftop, a place where I grow numerous plants, gives me the happiest hours in a day. I don’t call it a “garden” because it always seems a little messy. Tidiness or orderliness is never my strength. For me, to produce flowers in full bloom is much easier than keeping tools in order.</p><p>	</p><p>Someone may say that I have green fingers. Actually I had read a few books on gardening to get sufficient knowledge for growing flowers. Growth condition of each plant is different. Most of them need a lot of sunlight, but too much sun is bad for an orchid. Growing plants is just like breeding children. A child should be educated according to his natural ability and character. Such a theory can be applied to plant cultivation. Understand a plant well and treat it right, and then it will thrive. If you feed a plant too much fertilizer, it will only stunt its growth or even wither, just like spoiling a child may cause irreparable harm.</p><p>	</p><p>Being surrounded by scented and colorful flowers gives me a sense of well-being. When I present my productions to friends who have the same hobby, I feel a sense of accomplishment. But not every day is as joyful. Summer is a nightmarish season. When a typhoon is forecast, I have to install all the plants into a safe place, which will take me at least half a day. And it is a laborious and exhausting job to clean up the mess and ruins caused by the typhoon. Such troubles, however, never affect my love of gardening.</p>
