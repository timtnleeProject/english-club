<p><strong>Oct. 4, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>About Myself</em></strong></p><p>I was born in 1958 in Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, where the Air force training base is located. After graduating from junior high school, I attended the Naval Academy for the seven-year military education, and graduated in 1980 as a lieutenant. In the following years of my military career, I had served various positions of warships, from onshore staff to commanding officer, before I retired from the navy in 2008. Now I am an adjunct lecturer of the War College, National Defense University in Taiyuan.</p><p>	</p><p>During my 28-year-long military career, I gained a lot of English learning experience. In 1996 I led 200 officers and crews to the US Naval Base in Norfolk, Virginia, to perform the Ship Transfer Mission. At that time the USS Sumter (LST-1181) was transferred to the Republic of China Navy under the Foreign Military Sales program. The USS Sumter was then renamed ROCNS Chung Ping (LST-233), and I was the first commanding officer. We successfully completed our mission, sailing ships safely from the U.S. east coast, through the Panama Canal, across the Pacific, to Pearl Harbor of Hawaii, and finally arriving home port at Tso-ying Naval Base. Through those journeys, my men and I had practiced the Navy’s famous slogan commonly used in recruiting soldiers: “Join the Navy, and see the world.”</p><p>	</p><p>What I feel about ocean sailing can be summarized by the statement: “O, God. The sea is so great and my boat is so small.” The security of SLOCs (Sea Lanes of Communication) ensures the maintenance of maritime rights and interests. It is truly the vital lifeline of the national economy and overall security. The right Strategy for the Sea will benefit a sustainable economic growth, which guarantees national security, people’s welfare and interest, and peace between nations. With people’s support of government policies, the right Strategy for the Sea will succeed and national goals can be achieved as planned.</p><p>	</p><p>My family and I live in the Muzha Redevelopment Zone, and we enjoy Taipei’s rich and diverse information resources, various arts centers, and recreational facilities. In recent years, the growing trend of globalization and the increasing influence of the internet highlighted the importance of learning English. Learning English can help expand one’s horizon, vision and perspective. I wish my participation in the English club can improve my English skill, and I wish to learn more from my classmates, who come from various communities.</p><p>	</p><p>Reading, thinking and traveling add resources to life, and I especially love traveling and writing stories of literature. I hope to engage myself in becoming a local foreign language tour guide, an international tourist group leader, or even a traveler around the globe.</p>
