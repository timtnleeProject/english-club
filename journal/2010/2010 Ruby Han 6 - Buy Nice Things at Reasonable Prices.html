<p><strong>Oct. 6, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Buy Nice Things at Reasonable Prices</em></strong></p><p>There are three supermarkets in the same building located in Hsin-dian next to the Yu Long automobile company.</p><p>	</p><p>On the first three floors of the building is Carrefour (家樂福). It sells cheap but somewhat low-quality daily necessities. I always like to buy fruits, dairy products, and especially some small potted plants which help refresh and vitalize my room. A small potted plant just costs NT$29. If you encounter a promotional sale, four of them cost only NT$99. It’s far cheaper than those in either Mu-cha flower shops, where two potted plants cost NT$100, or Sing-long flower market, where three small plants cost NT$100. </p><p>	</p><p>The second one is B&amp;Q (特力屋), on the fifth floor, which provides customers all kinds of furniture and housing equipment. If you are interested in DIY, you could buy quality stuff at a considerably low price because B&amp;Q has chains around the world. I once bought a computer desk for less than NT$100, as well as two sets of lights decoration and one set of window curtains—two pieces of curtain and a copper pole with two copper-made accessories at its both ends, each at a reasonable price. What I like especially about the place is that you don’t need to give any reasons as to why you need to return the goods you already purchased. Taking your things you had bought with the receipt to the refund counter, you could get your money back easily.</p><p>	</p><p>The last as well as the best is the new HoLa department store, on the fourth floor. I used to go to Sogo or Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department stores to buy some quality stuff. Many years ago, I went to Sogo to buy a glass bottle as a vinegar container because the plastic one cracked easily. A small jar cost NT$360, and the middle and large ones cost NT$390 and NT$420 respectively. However, in my recent visit to HoLa, surprisingly, I found that the bottles of the same brand (Forma) and style just cost NT$209, NT$219, and NT$249 respectively in three different sizes. </p><p>	</p><p>Another special plastic jar of three different sizes, named水果花醋罐, made in Japan, was sold at Sogo at the prices of NT$420, NT$390, and NT$360 respectively, but at Hola, it was sold at the prices of NT$359, NT$349, and NT$269. The salesperson told me that the famous restaurant 鼎泰豐had been using this kind of jar over 10 years.</p><p>	</p><p>So if you want to buy cheaper quality stuff, the HoLa department can be one of the greatest choices. Play no fool and stop having yourself robbed.</p>
