<p><strong>May 6, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>About Me</em></strong></p><p>I was born in Taitung and grew up in Hualian. So, my early childhood was spent in the east of Taiwan, which is famous for its beautiful coastal scenery. After I graduated from the elementary school, we moved to Taipei partly because my father got promoted, and partly because my parents thought Taipei would provide for my elder brothers and me a better educational environment with its rich resources. So, I completed my high school and university studies in Taipei.</p><p>	</p><p>I’ve been married for more than 20 years. In order to take good care of my daughters, I quit my job while they were little. I have enjoyed being with them. Even now I am rejoicing at the fact that I had never been absent from any of the moments when they needed help, and that I had never missed any of their smiles or tears in each period of their growth. However, I still feel a bit sorry that I failed to develop my own career.</p><p>	</p><p>Now, my children are all grown up so I have more free time to take some courses I’m interested in, such as painting or English classes, to expand myself and to keep in touch with the crowd. That becomes one of the many delightful rites which have enriched my life.</p>
