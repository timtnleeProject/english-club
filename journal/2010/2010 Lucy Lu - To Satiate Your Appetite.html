<p><strong>Oct. 29, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>To Satiate your Appetite</em></strong></p><p>I’d like to recommend a fish port and a restaurant worth visiting. </p><p>My family likes eating fresh seafood, so we often travel around northern Taiwan on the weekends. We usually visit the traditional fish market to buy a variety of seafood, such as fishes, shrimps, crabs, clams, lobsters, sea vegetables and processed fish products. Sometimes, we also pick up a restaurant there to enjoy fresh fish cuisines.</p><p>If you are a foodie, I think you could not miss the elegant restaurant named Fu Mei (富美) Restaurant. It is located at the Oa Di (澳底) harbor, across from the fire department. The restaurant offers the fancy Chinese cuisine of seafood, serving the freshest seafood, which would tickle your taste buds. I promise you would lick your chops. The restaurant offers the most delicious seasonal ingredients. You could order your favorite food or just order a set mea. The charge is very reasonable. You only need to pay NT$2,500 for ten people, each with a set meal that includes 10 main courses, such as mixed seafood salad, steamed shrimp, wine chicken, raw fish meal, fresh fish soup, and fried vegetables.</p><p>Another fish port that I’d like to recommend is the Zhu Wei (竹圍) harbor. The fish market is a traditional market where the freshest fishes and ingredients are sold especially for tourists. The county government has built a wooden plank road and enlarged the parking area in order to boost local tourism. There are many street vendors and food booths around the market. Inside the market across from the parking lot, in the left-hand side corner, you can buy the most famous fish balls and all kinds of meal balls. The fish market offers much cheaper fish than any other markets. You could also eat many snacks there, such as oyster omelet, fried fish, and various processed fish products. I hope my suggestion will give another choice for an enjoyable weekend.</p>
