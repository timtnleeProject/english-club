<p><strong>Mar. 31, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Stomach Ache</em></strong></p><p>Before the Lunar New Year, my husband got a stomach ache; the doctor diagnosed him with a flu and gave him a shot and some medicine. Unfortunately, after he took the medicine, in two days, his problem got more serious: whatever he ate led to constipation. On the night of the 15<sup>th</sup> of January, we brought him to Ren-ai Hospital for an emergency. After a check-up with supersonic waves, the doctor found that all his digestion system had stopped functioning due to the painkillers, and that, consequently, all the food he ate was stored in his stomach.</p><p>	</p><p>All the hospital did was give my husband a big shot and some medicine to increase the movement of intestines, and he was asked to have a fast. It was not until the 19<sup>th</sup> of January that the doctor gave him a gastroscopy, trying to find the cause of my husband’s stomach ache. From the gastroscope, the doctor found many ulcers on his stomach. Aside from taking medicine, he must stay away from hot, sour and hard food, as well as alcohol and cigarettes. Most important of all, he must not allow himself to be hungry because it would hurt his stomach seriously.</p><p>	</p><p>In order to get well quickly, my husband was on a diet by strictly following the doctor’s orders: he should never eat apples unpeeled, guavas with seeds, sour pineapples or hard fiber vegetables such as celery or bamboo shoots. Apart from being selective about foods, he was forbidden to over-eat or miss any one meal. While he was at home, it was easy to get things under control, but it was difficult for him to get food to eat when he was outside home. So I kept reminding him to take some soda biscuits with him wherever he went: hiking, visiting friends, singing karaoke, or even playing mahjong. Now he has not had a stomach ache for over three months since he got sick in February. I took pride in doing such a great job, as our efforts had been awarded.</p>
