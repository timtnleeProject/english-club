<p><strong>May 7, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Two Birds</em></strong></p><p>I put the two bird cages into the closet at night and brought them out in the morning so that no one could bother my birds in their sleep. Keeping two birds in separate cages not only used up much more space but also increased my daily chores of cleaning their ‘dwelling.’ I always wondered why the two who had got along so well right at the beginning ended up living in two places. I thought there must be some ways to have them live together harmoniously again. And so I tried.</p><p>	</p><p>First, I placed a plastic ruler beside their cage after I put them together. Once my Xiao Ya Tou bit Xiao Ting Ting and made him jump up and down or fly around the cage, I would strike the table hard with the ruler and scream loudly, “I’ll beat you to death!” Usually, it worked: they would become quiet for a short while. But soon they would continue fighting again. Then I just played the same trick again. After I did it several times, my husband protested and wanted me to separate them instead. I refused. I told him, “Everything is difficult at the beginning, but if we insist upon it, we’ll succeed. You should help me scold them when they are fighting.”</p><p>	</p><p>After my daughter came home, she was too opposed to having the two birds live together in the same cage. When Xiao Ting Ting screamed in fear, she was much afraid that Xiao Ting Ting might get hurt. I promised her that Xiao Ting Ting would be safe because I would keep an eye on them all the time until they could be at peace with each other. But she still doubted me.</p><p>	</p><p>Despite their huge pressure on me, I always insisted on what I did. Even when I took a nap on the sofa, I would put the cage and the ruler beside me. As soon as they screamed, I would hit the desk without standing up to stop their fighting. In spite of much trouble, I always remembered to put them into separate cages for the sake of safety whenever I needed to go outside for a long time.</p><p>	</p><p>Gradually, my husband became used to yelling at my birds, “I’ll beat you to death.” I’m so sorry for our neighbors because my home was full of noises of screaming and beating during this period of time. Day after day, they fought less and less often. And now they are really living, playing and sleeping together peacefully and happily. This is another experiment to prove that with determination and persistence, you can do a great job.</p>
