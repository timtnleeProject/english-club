<p><strong>May 22, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Deadly Call</em></strong></p><p>Last Friday, while I was checking the schedule for Sunday’s activity, my cell phone rang. This phone call struck my mood down to the bottom.</p><p>The deadly call was made by the leader of Wan-Fang Hospital Breast Cancer Patient Volunteer Group, Anne. She told me that the hospital nurse who assisted us with volunteer work would gather all other volunteers to discuss my shortcomings, such as bad manners, loud voice, etc. This heart-breaking news shocked me a great deal. In short order, I dissuaded Anne from having such a meeting as it was no good to criticize any volunteers behind their backs. After talking with that nurse, Anne canceled the meeting but I was already deeply hurt. </p><p>Ever since the nurse joined our group, we have never got along well, but it is incredible that she would do such an unkind thing to me. Thinking of those days and nights during which I worked terribly hard for this group, such as typing meeting records, planning activities, taking pictures for every single activity and making the year-record, I suddenly felt like a fool, full of painful frustration and sadness.  </p><p>This Monday, an activity was held to teach people how to check their own breasts at Wan-Fang Hospital. I was intentionally absent from it as I was afraid to reveal my madness and disappointment in front of breast cancer patient volunteers. And I might give that nurse a very ugly look to show my irritation. That afternoon I got a call from my volunteer colleague. Her sincere encouragement and warm support made me feel much better, but I still did not know how to keep working with that nurse after I learned the fact that her real purpose was to replace me as the Group’s deputy leader.</p><p>Being a volunteer for over 14 years, I have never confronted this kind of situation. I keep thinking what I should do and hoping that I can soon figure out the best way to keep our group from being ruined by her.</p>
