<p><strong>Mar. 3, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>An Ill-Starred Marriage</em></strong></p><p>“It’s a gift, a memento. I would keep the baby.” The girl said with a nonchalant shrug. And the boy said: “Go to have an abortion. I insisted. I won’t marry you.”</p><p>“I’ll keep it whether you marry me or not. I insisted,” the girl replied. </p><p>They were very different. </p><p>The girl always went her own way with unconcern for the consequences. She went to school off and on and had habits of smoking and drinking alcohol. She stayed at her grandmother’s place when she was a baby and had never known where her mother had gone. The grandmother never sensed that the children needed to be disciplined. She brought them up as the conventional older people did, giving them adequate clothing and food. And then they grew up with a serious lack of discipline. Therefore the girl walked on the same path her mother had taken: having a baby and keeping it as a memento.</p><p>	</p><p>The boy, simple and obedient, was born on a farm, carrying great expectations from his parents. After several months’ study, he went to the top university of Taiwan and got a master degree of law and then became a lawyer. In the school dormitory, most students came from central and southern Taiwan, and had never been to the north. On countless holidays, they had planned to explore the northern part of Taiwan to satisfy their curiosity besides studying hard. They hired a tour bus or took buses to travel the whole downtown and suburb of Taipei. Those trips linked the simple boy and the wild girl together. A conductor of the tour bus, she led him to visit places he had never been to before.</p><p>	</p><p>Not until she became pregnant did they stop enjoying a wonderful time. About the baby, they disagreed with each other and refused to budge all the time. In order not to lose the baby, the boy’s parents forced him to marry the girl without considering the fact that the boy was still a student, and that the girl was not very suitable for their son, which led the couple into hell beyond redemption. In the beginning, the wife tried extremely hard to be a domestic woman, a mother and a lawyer’s wife. However, she failed because she had no idea how to be a wife and a mother, things she had never learned before. It confounded her. None could guide her although she had a lot of friends. As birds of a feather flock together, her friends are exactly the same as she, sociable but never capable of managing domestic affairs. She was sick of finding no way to improve the situation. Consequently, she started to find faults with her husband and spoke dirty words to provoke him over and over again for he was intent on learning and completely ignored her. As he found his wife’s highly unreasonable and offensive actions increased, he slept in the study to avoid her as much as possible, which made her go crazy. She kicked the door of the study and spoke dirty words to try to have a quarrel with him but always did it alone. Her husband always locked himself in the study and responded to nothing. Every time, she lost her marbles and cried hysterically like a dangerous lunatic. She had never been aware that the relationship was gradually ruined by her rude behaviors. They shared the apartment, but like strangers. She had been using the same way to deal with her husband whenever she felt upset.</p><p>	</p><p>“Out of sight; out of mind.” One day, the husband packed all his stuff, off to his law practice, and persisted to end their marriage since he couldn’t stand it anymore and actually felt there was only doom and gloom in the marriage. Thus he managed to get away from the endless conflicts and domestic violence. And she got all that he had left behind, including the two “mementos.” </p>
