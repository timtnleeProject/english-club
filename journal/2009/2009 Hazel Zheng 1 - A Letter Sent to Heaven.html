<p><strong>June 6, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Letter Sent to Heaven</em></strong></p><p>I was born in the 1920s, in a big family but a small and quiet poor village. Everyone had no way of knowing what destiny lay ahead. Maybe becoming a worker, a trader, or a farmer is among the few choices one could have at a bemusing age. In the agricultural society, the work was divided among sons by the old folks in the family. It was considered an immutable law by the whole family too—the reason why I became a farmer from childhood to old age and kept my feet on the ground until 80 years of age. Now, the word “farmer” is a synonym of me.</p><p>	</p><p>I observed traditional rules by starting work at daybreak and retiring at sunset. It wasn’t easy for a little child to take up life’s suffering. I endured not only the icy cold but also the extreme heat outdoors day after day, ever complaining. Sometimes, the routine work made me feel tired but I always managed to prevent negative thinking from bothering me—by setting my mind to treat my parents with fickleness and winning people’s respect for me.</p><p>	</p><p>Once I was unable to accept the reality of being trapped by a lonely life of hardship and boring work. I had wondered how to change my fate. Then I gave up soon because I was illiterate and had no choice but to face the fact. Keeping my feet on the ground was the only way at that time. Crying on the wild field perhaps helped drive away my inner scare. Thus, a cow had become my best friend while I was unhappy. It seemed to have apprehended the deep confusion in my mind.</p><p>	</p><p>In 1947, I got married with my wife, a child and a daughter-in-law. One year later, we delightedly had a son. Though life was as laborious as usual, now I tilled the land without complaint or confusion, for a new sense of responsibility had helped me regain strength. </p><p>	</p><p>Time was flying with the seasons alternating. My second son, Lon Han, was already six years old. In summer, the air is filled with hot waves, mixing the sun heat which reflects sparkles of light on the land. A couple of farmers were cutting rice plants, marching forward. In this season of harvest, they were preparing the whole year’s food for their family, bathed in sweat with their drenched clothes stuck to their bent backbones. “No pain, no gain,” I muttered.</p><p>The busy season preoccupied farmers’ minds so much that they cared little about things not related to work on the fields. In a mid-day, Lon Han came to me and said, “I have pain in my stomach, father.” </p><p>“I am very busy now. You should take a rest in bed. Later, I will take care of you.”</p><p>In dinner time, when I called my son to come and have dinner together, I couldn’t believe what I saw. My dear son was dead. In a fluster, I embraced his body tightly, and rushed out to the road, with tears blurring my sight. Afterwards, I did not remember what happened next. …</p><p>My dear brother, Lon Han, I was listening to your story as if you were here by my side. I could feel a sense of guilt hidden deep down at the bottom of my father's heart. That was why when he went to see the doctor, he always asked for a double dose of medicine. He said, “Now I have enough time, and the medicine can cure my dear son’s painful illness.”</p><p>I realized that all along he had kept you in his mind. I would have you know that life or fate was full of unpredictability. Though you’re in a different world, we all miss you and believe you must have gotten health and happiness in heaven.</p><p>Your younger sister,</p><p>Lezah</p>
