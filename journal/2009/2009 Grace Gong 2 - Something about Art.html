<p><strong>Oct. 14, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>Something about Art</em></strong></p><p>One evening, I walked to the library to find some art books about watercolor painting. I sat down to check those books I planned to borrow. Then, I saw a strange woman sitting diagonally across from me. I did not pay attention to what she was doing at first, but I noticed the woman wore a hat and a pair of sunglasses with a mask on her mouth as well as a long scarf around her shoulders. It seemed weird to dress like that in the night time. I supposed the woman was under some kind of therapy. Later, I went to the lady’s room. Someone was ahead of me, and the door of the room for the disabled was shot. After I came out of the toilet to wash my hand, from the mirror, I noticed that the strange woman was Nancy, whom I knew as a strange person when we worked in the same company. I spurted with laughter to say hi. She did not recognize me at first, but called out “Grace?” later with hesitation. She then was passionately leading me to go back to her seat. As a matter of fact, she was painting in the library. She showed me her drawings, some of which were gorgeous and amazing. It was interesting to see her having a style of her own. I asked many key questions about water colors and sketching skills. Generous to share her study and experience, she instructed me how to put a real substance on paper, how to sketch in proportion from a life size to put on a plane surface, and how to decide whether to display tableau horizontally or vertically. Nancy said, “Don’t make any excuses to suppress your enthusiasm in things which you are eager to learn. Keep it in high spirit, and you will find the way.” Nancy is eloquent with confidence. She used to be a tough person, but now her eyes are filled with peace and tender mercy. She is changed by art.</p><p>	</p><p>Nancy’s words are inspiring. Compared with her mature works, my paintings are at the initial stage. I paint when I am free. Sometimes I paint when I am alone. Whenever I paint, that is perhaps the most vivifying moment in my mind, transcending all housework and troubles. I had a beautiful postcard mailed to me from one of my friends who was traveling in Europe years ago, which said, “If food is the first priority in the world, then art must come as the second.” In my opinion, art is able to transcend all realities. It aims for timelessness but its essence lies in real life. In another word, art is created from trivialities in life; that is, we digest our actions, thoughts, experiences and emotions, and form a permanent appeal by a magic enzyme. Oftentimes, the simplicity of art can touch your soul. Gauguin Paul, the famous French painter, said, “I want to shock the whole world only by an apple.” I could sense the significance of his masterpieces.</p><p>I like to paint things which I am familiar with. For example, vegetables and fruits, plants and flowers, dishes and vases, fishes and birds, trees and rocks, rivers and houses, are all objects from life. The endless changes in lines and shapes, light and shadow, build me an intoxicating wonderland of fancy and exhilaration. Sometimes, I would modify my pictures several times until they satisfied me.</p><p>One of my favorite painters is Vincent Van Gogh, a Dutch impressionist. His painting “Starry Night’ really impressed me, which Don Mclean turned into an impeccable song that is still popular now. The melody lingered in my ears. Don Mclean interpreted Van Gogh’s pictures through the indelible lyrics. He wrote, “Starry, starry night, paint your palette blue and gray, look out on a summer’s day, with eyes that know the darkness in my soul . . .” and “Vincent, this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.” Van Gogh’s paintings were colorful but filled with thick loneliness as a sad view of his on this world. I had always imitated Van Gogh’s masterpiece, trying to find out how he mixed the oils smeared on the layout. If possible, I would like to taste his suffering, feel his life and envision the world inside of him. I pretended that I was Van Gogh, that I had the powerful brushes, but that was only my childish fantasy. Though my work shows accurate rationality and ingenious use of colors, it was hardly a comparison to Van Gogh’s creation, because my work lacks the kind of pain suffered through an acerbic journey which made Van Gogh unique. So, I tell myself: Don’t try to become another person; everybody is an unique individual, uncopyable and irreplaceable.   </p><p>	</p><p>A couple of days after I met Nancy, she called to invite me to paint the dyes on clothes, but I was unable to go. Shen then repeated on the phone with a pleasant tone, “Don’t’ ever stop painting!”</p>
