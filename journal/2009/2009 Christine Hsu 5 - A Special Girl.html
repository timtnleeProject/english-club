<p><strong>June 13, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Special Girl</em></strong></p><p>My elder daughter is a 170cm tall but simple-minded girl, popular among both female and male classmates. For me, she is helpful in doing chores and taking care of her younger sister. Recently she did two things that not only surprised me but also made me proud.</p><p>One night I asked my daughters to save for their father some honeydew I had prepared. But before I went to bed, I found only a little honeydew was left. I madly questioned them, but neither of them admitted that they ate more than I allowed. It was almost 10 oâ€™clock; I was too tired to blame them and so I punished them by having them kneel on the floor. </p><p>The next morning, I asked my younger daughter about what happened after I went to bed. She told me that about 30 minutes after I slept, my elder daughter went to prepare some apples for her father and assigned my younger daughter to help clean up the living room.</p><p>I was surprised by her way of making compensation. When I asked her about it, she said that was the only thing she could do, thinking that cleaning up the living room would eliminate my anger. This idea of hers reminded me that I could have asked them to do something to make up for their mistakes instead of giving them physical punishment.</p><p>The other thing that surprised me happened last Sunday. My elder daughter suddenly told me that she would stop having meat from this Monday for the sake of environmental protection. She said she would begin by practicing it for one week and then extend the time if she felt ok. As I was a vegetarian, I did feel that it was a brilliant idea to stop eating meat for whatever reasons. I felt pleased that my daughter got a positive influence from education. She not only understood the importance of protecting the earth, but also took actions for that cause, which was not an easy thing for a teenager.</p>
