<p><strong>Aug. 29, 2022</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Trip to the Matsu Islands</em></strong></p><p>I just came back from Matsu, where I did my military service twenty years ago. My first go-to place after landing was the barrack site where I had lived and worked for one year. To my disappointment, it was totally gone and replaced by a new observatory building. Suddenly, old memories were flooding back – memories of me living in a cave and working together with fellow soldiers in laughter and sweat, in extreme heat or cold.</p><p>The next place I will never forget is the Matsu Temple. A religious center for local residents, it also served as my spiritual shelter whenever I felt frustrated. The temple remained intact, but the secret bench on which I usually took a nap after lunch was removed. After I conducted a worship as I used to do, I said goodbye to this unforgettable and meaningful place in my life.</p><p>Nowadays there are fewer and fewer soldiers in Matsu as the need for military defense is on decline. The islands’ economy is transitioning from serving soldiers to serving tourists with the numerous trenches and cultural sites as well as many jaw-dropping sceneries. If you have never been there, I strongly suggest that you pay it a visit.</p>
