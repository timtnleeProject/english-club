<p><strong>Aug. 28, 2022 </strong>       </p><p><strong><em>A Playmate and Mentor        </em></strong></p><p>When I was a little kid, my family lived in a Japanese-style house with a big dooryard, which was distant from any household in my neighborhood. That was probably the reason why I rarely played out with neighbors’ kids, and my brother naturally became a regular playmate of mine. While playing either outdoors with stones and plants or indoors with the few “toys” we had, we always enjoyed our imagination games to pretend who we were not or imitate adults’ actions.  Thus, my brother and I forged a strong bond between us in a time of resource scarcity and financial instability. The tie between brother and sister remains close today.</p><p> </p><p>In my school days, my brother became my role model. Only two years older than I, he seemed much more mature, knowing very clearly about his future prospects and drawing up early plans accordingly. He tutored me in all lessons and helped me develop interest in math and get good grades in the following stages of learning. The most unforgettable words he said to me while I was preparing for the high school entrance examination were “Don’t ask yourself whether you can or cannot do something, just ask yourself if you want to do it or not.” If you want, certainly you can, he said. I was so impressed and surprised that I was speechless at that moment. How could a teenager have such great wisdom? Fortunately, I didn’t let him down. Over the years I have realized that it is exactly this attitude toward his life plan that has made him achieve all the goals in every stage of his life. </p><p>All along my brother has never stopped showing his concern for my family. He always eagerly offers support and gives professional advice, which especially benefited my daughters when they first entered the workforce. I truly feel so lucky to have a dear brother, faithful friend and true mentor like him.</p>
