<p><strong>Oct. 4, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Native Culture</em></strong></p><p>On Sep. 17, Hsieh Ai-ling, the chief administrator of residence under the Interior Ministry, and her husband, Mr. Ching, went to the Wenshan First Administration Center for matters of household registration. Because she did not bring with her sufficient certificates, a public official Miss Chang refused to deal with their case.</p><p>There and then, Hsieh asked Miss Chang loudly, "Don't you know who I am? Don't you know me?" After the girl and other clerks confirmed her identity from the internet, they apologized to her and gave the couple a piece of notice about what things people will bring to have household registration. Surprisingly, Mr. Ching got angry, crumpling up the paper into a ball and throwing it right at the poor girl's desk. The whole scene was videotaped by the camcorder in the office.</p><p>When the videotaped scene was exposed to the public, Mr. Ching blamed the Taipei City Government severely. "This is political oppression. The Taipei City Government has invaded our privacy." Oh! This is unbelievable! They ignored the law and acted rudely, but asked to be respected. Yes, they thought they were privileged people.</p><p>On Sep. 29, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Chang Tang-shan in a meeting criticized the Singaporean government's attempt to flatter China, suggesting that the former was "holding the latter's luan-pa", a language in Taiwanese so vulgar and low that even the journalists and reporters did not know what to do with the word. Finally, they used L.P. instead of the Taiwanese for penis,<em> luan-pa</em>. This news shook the international media, who tried hard to explain this term. One of them translated luan-pa as "a ball." The Taiwanese native culture has certainly been spread around the world.</p><p>Funnily, Premier Yu at a wedding ceremony last weekend blessed a newlywed couple by wishing them to have L.P. as early as possible. When all of the guests were astonished, Premier Yu said smilingly, "You don't twist the meaning of L.P. It simply means `little prince.’”</p>
