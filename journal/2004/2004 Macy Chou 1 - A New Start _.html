<p><strong>Sep. 17, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>A New Start  </em></strong></p><p>During my working days, I had planned to learn what I was interested in. Unfortunately, with most of them I had not even got started. I actually learned a few things, but they were all related to my work. Learning English was the one that did not work out. When I was a student, I had hoped that one day I could read English novels and magazines, and that I could communicate fluently with foreigners. But up till today, this hope has not come true yet.</p><p>A month ago, I read some information from the Taipei City Library about an English Club in its Mucha Branch. The place is not far from my home. The traffic is convenient also. The teacher is a nice and friendly lady. She told us she would not give us any pressure. I have retired from my job now, so I am free to do anything I want to. There are no excuses and barriers in front of me. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to take part in it.</p><p> I know it will take some more time to succeed. But I am not in a hurry. One of the reasons is I am too old to compete with young people. Another reason is I decided to only compare my new self with my old one. If I become better than before, even just a little bit, I would give myself applause and encouragement. Also, I do know I have to improve my learning attitude. I often give up learning halfway for some stupid reasons. I want to persist and persevere this time. As a matter of fact, I am planning to take an around-the-world trip when I am ready. I do hope I can overcome my weaknesses and achieve great results in my English learning.</p>
