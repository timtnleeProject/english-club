<p><strong>Nov. 8, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Gap</em></strong></p><p>After Friday morning's English class, I went to Taipei and met my college classmates at the Chiao Yuan Restaurant. Besides Chinese calligraphy we also talked about the health issues such as which hospitals had complete medical devices for physical check-up, and which charge patients least; what vitamin do we take everyday or every other day; how often we take exercises; what exercise is better for us the aged people? Swimming? Climbing or walking? Jogging or dancing? What food is good for our health? We didn't leave until the restaurant was closing for afternoon break. We all had a good time together.</p><p>One day I heard three young girls chatting on the MRT. One of them said she loved to listen to the songs of the singer Sun Yanzi very much. And another girl with long hair liked Asia's R&amp;B King David Tau because his song could cheer up the people in their darkest hours. The third girl said she liked best the new album of Jay Chou, Good Smell of 7 Miles, and that one of the songs Stopping Wars truly expressed the mind of young people. I was astonished by the fact that I rarely knew those singers they mentioned. Who are who? I only know Fei Yu-ching and Tsai Chin. Oh! So sad!</p><p>The famous TV star Chen Mei-feng said she had suffered insomnia for a long time. She tried many ways to improve her sleeping, such as drinking milk, doing light exercises, listening to the music and other secret methods before sleeping but they did not work. One day by chance she took out to read from the shelf a famous book Harry Potter, a gift from her friend a long time ago. Unexpectedly, she fell asleep quickly. She was indeed the alien among the Harry Potter fans all around the world.</p><p>We easily categorized ourselves into some specific group and could hardly communicate well with those outside our own group. How could we bridge the various gaps between one another? I think absorbing new knowledge and having a considerate heart are good inscriptions.</p>
