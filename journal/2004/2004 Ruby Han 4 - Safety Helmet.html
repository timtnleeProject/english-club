<p><strong>Nov. 22, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Safety Helmet</em></strong></p><p>In the afternoon on Mar. 20, 2002, I was taking the computer class at the 9th floor of Taipei Main Library. After the first severe earthquake, we sat back and studied again. Suddenly, another huge shake moved our teacher's computer down the floor and nearly all of our desks went to one side of the wall. We were so scared and screamed loudly. I really thought I could have been dead there. While we got down to the 7th floor we saw the roof in a corner cracking and many bookshelves and books falling down the floor. I headed over to the Da-an MRT station, but the train service was suspended. Everywhere on the streets, people were chatting with each other, with an astonished look on their faces. When I got on a taxi, the driver told me he could hardly hold the steering wheel as usual at the moment when the earthquake first began.</p><p>One of my friends told us her husband set a small table in the middle of the four pillars of her house and put some water, some solid provisions and three safety helmets in its drawer, so that he could get the 'necessities' easily whenever an earthquake came. Another friend of mine told me that her husband always finds a thick mat and puts it on his head when the earthquake happens. Since then I started to consider protecting my head was one of the important things to do during an earthquake.</p><p>The other day, we bought three safety helmets at a supermarket for my husband, my daughter and me. Their colors are black, blue and pink. Of course the pink safety helmet is for my daughter. Unfortunately, she did not care for it and even gave it a look. We put them somewhere easy to reach in our closet. I told my husband, "Should any earthquake happen, you must get back home as soon as you can because our home is the safest place in Taiwan."</p><p>Well, I'm just kidding.</p>
