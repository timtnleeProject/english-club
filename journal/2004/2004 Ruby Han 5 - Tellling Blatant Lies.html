<p><strong>Dec. 8, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Telling Blatant Lies</em></strong></p><p>The outline for senior high history textbooks of the 2006 school year was online last month. There are four chapters:</p><ol><li>Before the Japanese occupation – the period before the Japanese came to Taiwan</li><li>The Japanese occupation – (a) Taiwanese Reaction to the Japanese government (b) Taiwan's economic development (c) important construction (d) universal education</li><li>The ROC government – (a) 228 event (b) autocratic rule (c) political persecution (d) ten-thousand-year parliament (e) holding a seat for another term after being re-elected (f) democracy (g) direct presidential election</li></ol><p>In fact, under the rule of the Japanese government, our Taiwanese young men were not allowed to major in politics and economics but agriculture and medicine. We could not participate in any political activities or get any important role in the public service. Actually, if the ROC government had not given all citizens in the country a fair chance to receive the education, Mr. Chen Suei-bian could not have become the ROC president now, not to mention that he had suffered extreme poverty. During the Japanese occupation only rich children had the chance to go to school. I wonder if the Education Minister has forgotten about this part of history or is trying to flatter the Japanese for some purpose.</p><p>They did not mention one word about any of the accomplishments the ROC government had achieved. In the early 1940 Mr. Sun Yun-hsuan visited every remote corner of Taiwan to make sure the farmhouses could equally enjoy the power service. He developed high industrial technology, so that our country and people were freed from the labor industry and poverty. Stanley Yen upgraded our tour industry, bringing a lot of foreigners to Taiwan to help our tour industry pass the crisis of the early 1990. But the Democratic Progressive Party government ignored all of the achievements of the previous rule. They are cheating in public. I don't know how the government could teach the students with such a confusing standard of value.   </p>
