<p><strong>Sep. 15, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Kind Boss</em></strong></p><p>It was really embarrassing when I found I had no money to pay for the fish I decided to buy. Stunned, I tried to explain about my forgetfulness. The boss did not complain but offered to lend me some money. I was amazed by her generosity and friendliness. She even thought maybe NT$1,000 was not enough for me and then took it out from her pocket as I hesitated there. I was really touched by her kindness, and so I asked her to keep my fish before I came back later with money.</p><p>I wondered why both of us felt unhappy after her kind suggestion was declined by me. It is true that all of us urban people tend to build an invisible wall between each other for safety and protection. It was difficult to shorten the long distance between people. Why wouldn't we be like the country people who love and believe simply? The social complexity and sophistication limit us and turn us into cruel city people.</p><p>To give and to take are both important to us. Why don't we open our hearts to learn how to do both well? It is important that there should be faith between each other, I guess.</p>
