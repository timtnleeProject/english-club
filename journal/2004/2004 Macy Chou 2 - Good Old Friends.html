<p><strong>Sep. 27, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Good Old Friends</em></strong></p><p>Last Tuesday my former colleagues invited me to take part in their Bar-B-Q party in Zudin village. I had not seen them for almost one and a half years since I retired from my job. To grasp this rare chance of meeting them, I even canceled an appointment with my dentist.</p><p>They asked one of my favorite colleagues who used to sit next to me to pick me up. Rapturous to see each other, we talked so eagerly that we missed some road signs. We had to spend one more extra hour to get there. All my friends were anxiously waiting for us to have lunch. Hungrily, too, I suppose. Seeing us arriving, they came running to give me a warm hug.</p><p>As it was raining all day, everything seemed to be washed and cleaned. The weather was cool and comfortable. The scene over there was hazy and beautiful, with mountains in front of the house, and rivers running beside the farm. We picked off pomelos, lemons and bananas, with our umbrella in the rain. Some of my friends even suggested killing a few chickens which were strolling in the yard, but no one really dared to do so.</p><p>We planned to visit Pinshi and Chintung after lunch. Pinshi is famous for its traditional sky-lantern. Chi Tung is an abandoned coal mine. Both villages are not far away from the farm, and are reconstructed for tourism. Before we left we put some sweet potatoes, taros and chicken wings into the oven. We were expecting the food to be ready by the time we were back. Later, however, we found the stuff had been totally burnt out after our two hours' sightseeing. Fortunately, we had prepared a lot of beef, pork, fish, shrimp, cuttlefish, and various mushrooms, vegetables, etc. Because we had many helpers, we had our Bar-B-Q dinner prepared quickly. The food was plenty and delicious. After we were all full, we had tea with snacks and moon cakes. It was dark outside and the sound of the rain and river was melodious. The house was filled with laughter and singing.</p><p>How we had enjoyed the day! But happy times always pass regrettably fast. It was almost ten o'clock after we cleaned the house and got ready to leave. We were all wishing to see one another in the near future, but deep in our heart, we knew exactly how rare a chance it was for good old friends to get together in this fast-paced, schedule-tight society.</p>
