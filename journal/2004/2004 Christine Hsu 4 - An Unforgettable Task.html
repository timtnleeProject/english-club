<p><strong>Nov. 5, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>An Unforgettable Task</em></strong></p><p>On Oct. 22, after preparing dinner for my kids, I excitedly rushed to catch the train to Hualien. While I got the task to entertain foreign guests, I was full of anticipation but at the same time afraid that I couldn't properly introduce Tzu-Chi University with my insufficient knowledge. After doing it, I found it was even more difficult than I had thought. I still need to learn more, like English and reception etiquette. Fortunately, I got many volunteers to help me and check upon what I did, such as not speaking loudly, keeping smiling and so on.  For this mission, I not only had the honor to join the celebration of the 10th anniversary of Tzu-Chi University (TCU), including an outdoor party and school sports, but also was welcomed as one of those distinguished guests. How grateful and delighted I felt!</p><p>The next morning, a volunteer and I went to pick up our guests, including five doctors from Indonesia University and four Indonesian volunteers. When we arrived at the Hualien Airport, two Indonesian teachers from TCU had already been waiting there. One of them helped us a lot during the two days. The gifts we prepared for each guest was a bag containing a white handkerchief embroidered with each guest's name by our volunteers, and a tiny bag of potpourri, which filled the handkerchief with fragrance. When they got their gifts, I could see from the look on their faces that they were touched and surprised. It was the first time for me to entertain a principal and so many doctors. I was too nervous to say a single word until we got out of the van. With their tight schedule, as well as the many interpreters of different languages surrounding them, I had few chances to talk to them.  Even so, I managed to recognize all guests and made no mistakes when I sent them to their rooms at 8:30pm. We said good night to each other warmly.  To me, this was an incredible day and I was glad that everything went smoothly. At least, I didn't lose any guests after we joined the outdoor activity, which involved over 2,000 people.  After settling the guests, all volunteers gathered together to discuss the schedule for the next day.</p><p>"Humanity night" in Still Thought Hall was the last program of the first day. Those teachers and students of elementary school, junior high school, college and university from Indonesia, South Africa, China and Tzu-Chi, performed several wonderful shows to celebrate the special day. The two female doctors beside me wept when the kids from Wuhan China, who were abandoned by their parents, were singing the song, "Mom, Where Are You?" The next show, "The picture of lamps kneeling down while sucking milk" was even more touching! We thought the performer on stage with only her left hand and right foot was 'acting' out the role of a cripple until the host explained to us that the actress had actually lost her right hand and left foot because of a car accident and bone cancer respectively. When I translated it to the two doctors, they were speechless and in great sorrow.</p><p>In Indonesia, there were only about 40 commissioners, but they had not only reconstructed the Angke River, but also built houses and a primary school. After one year, those residents who used to live beside the Angka River moved to the new community and got their own house. At the Humanity night, all members were impressed by those Indonesian kids' performance and etiquette. One year ago they were still a group of poorly educated kids. They got their fund from people in Indonesia, but they felt most thankful to Master Cheng-Yen and all volunteers around the world.</p><p>Fifteen kids from South Africa were very lovely. Their spirited nature and vivid traditional dance not only brightened up Humanity Night but also cheered people from 17 countries at the school sports the next day. It was the first time for me to wear a Chi-Pao and dance with over 2,000 people.  Two South African kids as representatives of their group gave an interesting speech in perfect Taiwanese dialect, which delighted all audiences. Their hearty and sincere gratitude was fully expressed through their words. People say that a one-minute performance on stage takes 10 years to accomplish. It was hard to imagine how much time they had spent practicing these Tzu-Chi songs and the perfect speech. They learned not only the Taiwanese dialect, but also the use of chopsticks. Education really changed their lives. It was hard not to admire them! I had no words to describe how touched I was by each group's performance.  I clapped hard to show my appreciation and admiration.  That night, Still Thought Hall was full of joyful tears and unforgettable memories.</p><p>The next day, teachers and kids, from home and abroad alike, marched into the sports oval. What a spectacular scene: they might have outnumbered the overseas Taiwanese returning home for the Double Tenth Day. At the end of the activity, students held the flags of the Tzu-Chi Foundation and Tzu-chi's four schools as well as national flags of 17 countries to lead all members to withdraw from the field. The view was awesome with all flags flying in the backdrop of the Central Mountains standing tall and the clouds floating in the sky.</p><p>The two days were flooded with praises and thankfulness! Everything was perfect; the food was no exception. All volunteers were mindful to prepare all meals. All guests fully enjoyed the dishes--all vegetarian--as well as the volunteers' hearty service, never provided without sincere and sweet smiles. I was so lucky to have great meals with foreign guests. On the first night, we had some famous snacks from different cities of Taiwan. When I introduced the so-called "coffin lid"---a famous local product of Tainan, they couldn't believe what they heard. "Really? Why?" they kept asking. It was hard for them to imagine that the delicious food had such a horrible name. All our guests said they already ate as much as they could.  Nevertheless, they still couldn't finish it all. I totally agreed with them.</p><p>Being the above-mentioned 2-day volunteer was not at all an easy task, and yet I treasured it as one of the great opportunities I had ever had. When I said good-bye to all the guests, I felt a little bit sad. How many chances are there for us to meet again in a lifetime? Maybe this was the first as well as the last one, so I cherished it dearly.</p>
