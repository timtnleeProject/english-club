<p><strong>June 28, 2024</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Diligent Life Embracing the Present and Future</em></strong></p><p>I have always considered myself a diligent person. This trait likely stems from my childhood environment and family upbringing. I was born during the baby boom years when people were hard-working, pursuing wealth, and striving to become rich. During that time, industriousness was a fundamental element of life.</p><p>As I grew up, whether in school, in marriage, or at work, I tried to demonstrate my abilities to meet required standards. Although my results were often average, sometimes I didn't push myself to achieve more and instead found comfort in accepting mediocrity, telling myself, "The sun will still rise tomorrow." These situations occurred repeatedly. Reflecting on the past, I realize that I adopted an easygoing attitude to avoid driving myself crazy.</p><p>Retirement has been a pleasant time for me. I enrolled in various classes to pass the time, made and chatted with friends, and explored new interests. Over the years, I have learned many things beyond my imagination, such as different viewpoints, lifestyles, habits, family relationships, and the stock market. These experiences exceeded my expectations. I learned that listening and respecting others are essential behaviors for getting along well with people. During this period, I also became a grandmother, which I consider my highest accomplishment. Although I occasionally fantasize about choosing a different path and not getting married if I could live my life over again, it remains just a personal daydream.</p><p>As I age, I recognize that my DNA is embedded in my mind and spirit. I keep reminding myself to appreciate what I have, improve my shortcomings, and create a roadmap for a fulfilling life. My guidelines are as follows:</p><ol><li>Be grateful for what you have.</li><li>Remember to exercise to maintain good health.</li><li>Be compassionate and kind to others.</li><li>Think before you speak.</li><li>Avoid actions that harm others and do not benefit yourself.</li><li>Refrain from saying words that hurt others and do not benefit yourself.</li><li>Release pressure and maintain a balanced life of body and mind.</li></ol><p>I always tell myself, "Every day is a bonus. Have a nice day every day."</p>
