<p><strong>June 30, 2024</strong></p><p><strong><em>Sharing and Listening</em></strong></p><p>To build a harmonious family, I believe that sharing and listening are two of the most indispensable factors. Whether it is between married couples, parents and children, or even for those choosing a future partner, the willingness to listen and share is essential.</p><p>Sharing is not just about venting negative emotions; it is more about exchanging each otherâ€™s happiness. This includes sharing funny moments from your day, academic achievements, career fulfillments, and the growth processes of children.</p><p>Listening demonstrates care, understanding, support, and respect for the speaker, whether it is your spouse or children. The more you listen to them, the more they will be willing to share with you. This promotes communication, establishes trust, and enhances mutual feelings.</p><p>In summary, sharing and listening are fundamental exercises connected to each other in our daily lives. Through practice, we can understand each other better and maintain stronger and happier relationships within our family.</p>
