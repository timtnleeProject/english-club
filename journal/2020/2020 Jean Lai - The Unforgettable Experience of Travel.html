<p><strong>Jan. 31, 2020             </strong></p><p><strong><em>The Unforgettable Experience of Travel</em></strong></p><p>Japan has always been known as a land of propriety, and the Japanese are usually regarded as one of the friendliest peoples. Is that still so? Or perhaps the whole world has changed.</p><p>Several years ago, my husband, my daughter and I took a trip to Osaka. On the last day of the trip, when we were standing in a line waiting for the bus to Kansai Airport, we were informed that the bus was going to be delayed, but we were not told for how long. Thus, both my husband and daughter went to the convenience store just several paces away.</p><p>In just a few moments, however, the bus came, and everyone started to move steps and baggage in a hurry. Embarrassedly, I fell into a flurried predicament when I found it too hard for me to move all three pieces of luggage at one time. I looked around for my husband and daughter while I was awkwardly moving the baggage with both my hands and feet. In the meantime, I saw people passing right by my side quickly and emotionlessly, none of whom had the intention of giving me a hand. I felt so helpless; still, I staggeringly arrived at the bus stop.</p><p>This, nevertheless, was not the worst. As soon as the driver helped me put the luggage in the trunk, I started to run toward the convenience store In order to hurry my husband and daughter back to the bus. To my surprise, the driver rapidly stopped me while gabbling something that I didn’t understand. Unfortunately, I spoke no Japanese except the word “wait.” Neither of us understood what the other said. Now I was in extreme anxiety and panic—everybody had been on the bus already, and our baggage also. The stalemate between the driver and me was not broken until a few minutes later when I saw my husband and daughter running toward us. Finally we all got on the bus.</p><p>I was getting calm after settling down on the bus. Recovering from the shock that had just happened, I talked to my husband and daughter about the experience. When I half-jokingly described how the driver’s jabbering seemed to be intended for keeping me from leaving as if I had been carrying two bombs on the bus and trying to run away for life, we all laughed out loud. On second thought, however, that might be the actual reason for his gabbling.</p><p>As to the indifference of the passengers on the same bus, although I know it is common that people nowadays are unwilling to give help lest they should get in trouble, I still take it to heart that I wasn’t given a hand when I needed it the most.</p>
