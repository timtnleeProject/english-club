<p><strong>Dec. 15, 2020</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Little Corner of Warmth</em></strong></p><p>One night while taking a walk around the Muzha Elementary School, I was surprised to see a bowl and a black cat on the campus wall. Glancing right and left, I found a middle-aged man with a bag strolling down the sidewalk. Curiously, he had been feeding the stray cats there every night over the years. Out of mercy, he brought them food, water, and even medicine. Equally compassionate, a kind woman shared his duties: they divided the area into two parts and took care of the cats that wandered in their “zones'' respectively.  If one of them was unavailable, the other would automatically take over the job to feed the cats in the partner’s zone. They are such great people!</p><p>Among the cats, I was particularly interested in the one with brown and white spots sitting lazily on the ground. Whenever I </p><p>approached it, it would immediately run away, but whenever the man walked to it, it would sit still or touch the man’s hand with its head.  Animals are spiritual beings. They know exactly who cares for and about them. I am really happy to have seen the tenderness that the cat gave the kind man in return.</p><p>*		*		*		*		*</p><p>The multiple trees in the Muzha Park always attract various kinds of birds such as pigeons, sparrows, magpies, pugs, black-neck birds, and even Taiwan Blue Magpie. They seem to enjoy staying in the park to play or find food to eat. Adults or children alike love these birds and often feed them with rice, beans, or fruit. Recently, my husband became one of their fans. In the middle of nearly every day in the park, he would sprinkle on the ground the papaya and apple peels cut into pieces mixed </p><p>with rice. Then, the birds or even the squirrels would be running, flying, and landing nearby to enjoy the treat heartily. Almost all the birds as the guests of the feast liked the papaya seeds especially, while the squirrels were fond of bread crust and apple skin. The pigeons, however, loved whatever was fed to them.</p><p>One day, puzzledly, my husband found that no birds would fly down to eat their food. Later, he discovered an iron cage with live worms hung on it to entrap the birds in the park. My husband was furious and warned the cage owners to leave the birds alone, or he would report them to the Animal Protection Association.</p><p>In the following few days, there were still no birds flying to the park. Luckily, maybe the birds gradually realized that they were out of danger, so they came back again. With a sigh of relief, we are now able to restore our feeling of happiness when watching the birds eating, chirping, and chasing each other in the park -- a little corner of warmth and love.</p><p> </p>
