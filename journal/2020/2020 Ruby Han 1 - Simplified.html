She said, “It’s very handy; we can make carrot juice, bean milk, papaya milk juice, watermelon juice, tomato juice, etc. We don’t need to buy any juice again; we can make it ourselves.”</p><p><a id="_heading=h.2et92p0"></a></p><p><a id="_heading=h.tyjcwt"></a>Because of this machine, I recalled the early history of my cooking. Back then, I bought many kinds of pots to cook, from Tatung electric pot, fast pot, slow pot, baking pot, electronic pot, and stainless steel pot to chafing pot. I believed every pot had a special function, so my kitchen is filled with all kinds of pots. However, I seldom used them. Finally, those pots became the home of cockroaches and started to emit a bad smell. At last, I sent some of the pots to my friends and threw away most of the rest. Among them, I think the Tatung electric pot is the best tool for cooking. You can use it to steam meat, fish, egg, shrimp, crab -- anything you can think of -- at the same time while you are cooking rice with it. What’s more, you can use it to boil the rice congee, something that the electronic pot cannot do.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.3dy6vkm"></a></p><p><a id="_heading=h.1t3h5sf"></a>After I cleared away those pots, my kitchen seemed to become larger and cleaner. While I’m happy and satisfied with the present condition of my kitchen, my daughter brought in this new gadget! What am I going to do with it? Well, using the new machine to make some juice may seem fun, but the aftermath is definitely unpleasant. That is, every time after making some juice, you’ll be busy cleaning, drying and putting it away, or the machine will get a bad smell. In fact, I’m convinced that any fresh food is better for our health than juice, and that juice is better for those who don’t have a good stomach or good teeth. As simplicity is always the golden rule of my life, naturally, the machine is lying in the corner still and unpacked.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.4d34og8"></a></p>
