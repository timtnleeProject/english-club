<p><strong>May 15, 2019</strong></p><p><strong><em>Forward to My New Boook</em></strong></p><p>	I have to start by thanking my sister-in-law, Mr. Yang Chong-yue (楊崇岳先生) for introducing me to teach at the Taipei First Girls’ Senior High School, where I made good friends and learned important life lessons.</p><p>	I’m eternally grateful to Mr. Cheng Zhi-zhai (程植齋先生),  my mentor in calligraphy, who taught me with great patience and kindness.</p><p>	A Special thanks to  Master Xie Zong-an (謝宗安先生) and Master Lin Long-da (林隆達先生) who had step by step led me into the rich vast field of Chinese calligraphy.</p><p>	To my daughter, who showed me how to compile the articles and deal with problems related to publication. To my son-in-law: Thank you for resolving computer crises.</p><p>None of this would have been possible without my English teacher, Ms. Jennifer Chiu (邱文媛老師). If she hadn’t encouraged and pushed me, I wouldn’t have written all these journals in English for nearly 15 years. She not only revised my writing carefully but also posted them online regularly so that I can find all the articles I need easily and even get to publish this book. I have great respect for her.</p><p>My final thanks go to the Muzha Branch of Taipei City Library, which has</p><p>been providing us a wonderful place to learn and study English over decades: Thank you for being a part of my personal growth.</p>
