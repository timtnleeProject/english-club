<p><strong>May 13, 2019</strong></p><p><strong><em>The 10 Rules of Doing Good</em></strong></p><ol><li>Whenever you see an elderly, a pregnant woman, or a disabled person standing on the bus, yield your seat quietly to them. Don’t feel embarrassed if they show their appreciation loudly. Just smile back at them.</li><li>When you find a wallet someone has lost, send it back to its owner. If you are in great need of money, you can keep the cash, but you must send back the credit card, the ID card, and the driver’s license. These things are much more important than the money. Write down the address of the wallet owner in your notebook, and when you are no longer short of money, send the money you took as well as your apology.</li><li>If a stranger gets lost and checks with you about the direction, help him as much as you can. Don’t be shy when being stared by passersby.</li><li>If you come across a child or an elderly who lose his way, try to help him find his way home, call his family, or at least take him to the nearest police station.</li><li>When you see street vendors at night, don’t make a bargain but try to buy  from them as much as you can. If they could get by, they wouldn’t have to endure such a cold weather in the dark.</li><li>Buy whatever is being sold by students who work as part-timers, especially poor high school students or little girls. It takes courage to sell things from door to door, or from person to person. Try to encourage them and give them warmth.</li><li>If you have money more than enough to spend, don’t get yourself a mistress, but try instead to adopt orphaned children from poor remote areas. The former act may lead to a haunting feeling of fear and guilt while the latter brings you a feeling of satisfaction and happiness.</li><li>For the sake of forest conservation, recycle all types of paper, including toilet paper and paper towels. Don’t throw away writing paper easily, especially those with only a few written or typed words or with one side left blank.</li><li>To keep our environment sustainable, always bring shopping bags with you instead of buying plastic or paper bags from the stores or getting them free. Refuse to use disposable tableware and straws -- made of either plastic or paper.</li><li>If you reckon that the above-mentioned conducts are good deeds, please pass the words to people you know. Undoubtedly, we will feel much more at ease in heart if surrounded by people who consider themselves global citizens.  </li></ol>
