<p><strong>Sep. 10, 2021</strong></p><p><strong><em>Laws</em></strong></p><p>In order to keep the society in order, every country has laws. Laws declare human rights (what people can do) and responsibilities (what they must and mustn’t do).  Also, there will be punishments for people who break the laws.</p><p>Although every country has laws, not all have the same idea of justice. Something legal in one country may be considered illegal in another. Even the states in the USA have different laws. A driver can turn right at the red light in some states, while he may receive a ticket from the police if he does the same in other states where turning right at the red light is forbidden by law. Some states insist that capital punishment serves justice in murder cases while others denounce it stubbornly. </p><p>There are many kinds of punishments for people who fail to abide by the laws. It is hoped that the punishment will act as a deterrent to crime. However,  if the punishment is too light to be proportionate to the crime, the convict may think it a real bargain and feel neither fearful nor regretful. On the other hand, no matter how serious the punishment may seem, if the laws are not strictly enforced, people will think that they can luckily escape the legal punishment. In either case, the laws will not deter crimes but increase recidivism.</p><p>More than once, we are told that all are equal before the law. It’s definitely untrue in reality. On the contrary, it’s a universally acknowledged truth that laws only protect those who either know the laws or are rich. If a man doesn’t know laws, he is at a disadvantage and will always lose a lawsuit. On the other hand, if a man is too poor to hire a lawyer, which usually costs a fortune, he can hardly win the litigation without a lawyer’s defense for him. For those who have a lot of money to burn, they can hire a top notch lawyer or even a team of them to exploit loopholes in the law to get away with their crimes; furthermore, rich people can also lobby or even bribe lawmakers to pass the bill that is in favor of them.</p><p>It often happens that a judgment passed by a court doesn’t meet the society’s expectation. In Taiwan, a criminal once caught only has to put up an appearance of remorse for the evil that he has done or copy numerous Buddhist scriptures, and then the judge will decide that the criminal can be civilized and should be given criminal commutation. Why would a judge in court believe such ridiculous things? Is it because our judges are only good at taking exams but have the least knowledge of the world? Besides the above two reasons, maybe the International Organization for Avoidance of Death and the local institutions for national human rights are also the keys to the failure of our judicial system. Isn’t it unfair that those organizations are only concerned about the perpetrators’ human rights but ignorant of the rights of victims and their family? These so-called human rights groups are always in favor of and care only about perpetrators. Shouldn’t they be more concerned with the loss and suffering of the victims and help them recover from the misery and gain justice?</p><p>As a common saying goes, a petty larcenist pilfers money, while a great larcenist steals laws. Based on historical observations, it is safe to say that when a dictator rules the country, he will tailor the law for his personal ambition, and that once a politician holds power, he will collude with consortiums or gangs to get benefits by dark, secretive, and corrupt methods. Every law has a loophole; a statesman seeks ways to plug it, while self-serving politicians take advantage of it to get money.</p>
