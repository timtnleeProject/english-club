<p><strong>Oct. 15, 2021</strong></p><p><strong><em>The First Man of Soong’s Family</em></strong></p><p>One day, I found in the library the book <em>The First Man of the Soong Family </em>(宋氏家族第一人), written by Yu Xing-min(于醒民). At first, I didn’t think much of it. After reading a few pages, however, I couldn’t put it down. In 1875, a boy at the age of 12 went ahead to Boston with his foster father. Their ship sailed along South America before it was hit by a big floating ice in the Strait of Magellan. Fortunately, the ship was drifting to an unnamed island of Antarctica. After the ship was well repaired, they continued their journey. The ship finally stopped at Cuba through all kinds of hardships, for it could not go any further. Under his foster father’s arrangement, the boy stayed at a silk-tea store in Havana, Cuba for two years. The boy was Soong Jia-shu (宋嘉澍), aka Soong Yao-ju (宋耀如).</p><p>    </p><p>In the winter of 1877, he went to America by himself and found his foster father’s shop though he had learned in the Cuban store only three English words – silk, tea, and shop. His father counted on him to promote the Soong’s family business, so he hired an experienced and skillful teacher to teach him two hours a day. The teacher who was a Lincoln’s admirer taught him tirelessly a lot of stories of Abraham Lincoln besides teaching him English. Therefore, he began to understand about the American Revolutionary War, the movement of slave emancipation, the American Civil War, and Lincoln’s political ideals — of the people, by the people, and for the people. Boston is the cradle of revolution, a symbol of freedom and equality, and a place where the first shot of revolutionary war was fired.</p><p>     </p><p>Because of some of his young friends’ encouragement, Soong hoped to study further at college, but his foster father didn’t approve of his decision. He had no chance but to escape from home at night, kneeling down outside with tears and saying good-by sadly. During the time when he was hiding, a great, kind old American named Charlie Jones not only provided him a temporary shelter but taught him to know God, the Bible, Abraham Lincoln, and the three democratic principles. Since then, the pursuit of freedom and equality became his lifelong goal. In order to thank the wise, generous and selfless old man, he named himself Charlie Jones Soong for the rest of his entire life. Under Jones’ help, he found a job as a cabin boy at the age of 15 on the anti-smuggling boat in the U.S. Coast Guard (美國海岸警備隊緝私艇). As smugglers were strong and violent, everyone in the boat needed to learn the skills of fencing, boxing, and fighting. Being brave, vigorous and enthusiastic, Charlie won himself a nickname “Small Cannonball.” Captain Eric Gabrielson treated him like his own son and took great care of him. Although Charlie wanted to follow the captain for a new mission, the captain refused and said, “The greater knowledge, the better.” He ordered Charlie to take off the military uniform and get back to school. For days, in order to help Charlie find a place to stay,  the captain kept him company to walk under the scorching sun through the city Wilmington, North Carolina until they ran into a pastor named Pecherico. It is at this time that young Charlie decided to save his suffering motherland by being a priest to awaken Chinese people in the same self-sacrificial spirit of Jesus Christ. </p><p>On Nov. 7, 1880, Charlie became a Christian, with Pastor Pecherico presiding over the baptism. On Apr. 2, 1881, he got a four-year sponsorship from General Julius Carl, an industrialist  living in Durham N.C. , for the Trinity College Dublin (聖三一學院後改名為杜克大學) and Seminary of Vanderbilt University in St. Tennessee. Forty years later, General Carl, who had always expected Charlie to become a political leader, witnessed the unforgettable day when Charlie was recognized as a man who affected the modern history of the country with the world’s largest population. More than six decades later, Wilmington City built a memorial hall in honor of Charlie Soong. </p><p>During the time when Charlie was studying hard, he organized an Evangelistic Group. Local people responded enthusiastically to his speeches and fundraising. However, whenever he started praising Lincoln, the audience would run away because at that time almost all southerners still kept slaves. Charlie determinedly fought against the system of slavery, insisting that no one would want to be a slave. The next day’s local news reported, “This noble young man was from China. We don’t agree with him but we admire his outstanding character and talent.” From then on, the American public opinion started paying attention to the young man who would soon be rising.</p><p> </p><p>In the summer of 1884, the Sino-French War broke out. At that time, the anti-Chinese movement was everywhere in America. Despite possible dangers, Charlie with some American friends held up a wooden sign to raise funds for protesting against the brutal French invasion of China. At the end, a donation of around US $12,000 raised by him was sent to the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Of course, not all things went smoothly with him. Although he passed the medical college admission test by topping the list of candidates, Mr. Mark Diye, the bishop of Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Tennessee, insisted to send him back to China and had him subordinated to the Dean of American Supervisory Council in China, Andrew Young John William Allen (林樂知), who had a good relationship with the Qing Court and managed an influential publication — the <em>Review of the Times</em> (萬國公報).</p><p>In January of 1886, Charlie returned to Shanghai to start his missionary work. Soon he found there was no equality, no freedom, and no democracy anywhere in China. The Shanghai Public Garden, for example, was permitted to foreigners only. In July, Charlie and some Chinese clergies and good friends successfully proposed the Public Concession Ministry of Industry (公共租借工部局) to tear down the sign of “No Dogs and Chinese Allowed in Shanghai Bunk Park.” What he did made Dean Willian Allen very unhappy. He dispatched Charlie to work at a remote area of Qunshan.(崑山). Before he went ahead there, he took a priest’s advice to grow hair in order to follow the Chinese tradition. Unfortunately, no one welcomed him, not to mention to make donations to help build the church; instead, they threw the stones and spit at him. Disregarding the difficulties and humiliations, he walked to the riverside to get some mud and burn it into bricks, the skill of which he learned in America. He then piled up the bricks to make a wall. Unexpectedly, the local people demolished it at night. Several times later, a young man named Da Lio was moved by his perseverance and joined his work, but no progress was made at all. Suddenly, a good idea popped up in Charlie’s head. With his keen business sense and his Chinese and English proficiency, he should be able to raise funds by himself. As a comprador, he went back and forth between Shanghai and Qunshan by a little wooden boat made by himself. Less than two months later, he earned enough money to build a simple church. Full of joy, he brought his fiancée Ni Guei-zhen (倪桂珍) from Shanghai to celebrate the church’s opening ceremony. Upon their arrival, however, they only saw a pile of rubbles with nothing else left. Speechless, they knelt down on the ruin with tears and prayed to rebuild what had been destroyed by the local gentry. Still, people said, “How could he pollute this place and his own Chinese culture with a foreign religion?”(聖教之鄉豈容夷狄沾汙) The American Supervisory Council requested him to go back to Shanghai, but he rejected it and said, ”This is my first mission. How can I leave without having it completed?” Things didn’t improve; what’s worse, everything in his house was smashed by malicious mobs. American priest Read came to his rescue and suggested a necessary penalty on those mobs. However, Charlie objected, “If anyone gets punished, I’ll file a complaint to the Prime Minister Office. All in all, I think the case should be dropped.”</p><p>Under the insistence of Dean Willam Allen, Charlie was transferred to a farther place to do missionary work. In Cibao, Tachang, Charlie in his coarse clothes and straw sandals worked with villagers in the field, founded a church school, built a children’s playground as well as a clinic, and printed multiple copies of the Bible. Besides American history, he also included in the educational program military training courses for improving individual physical fitness and national strength. Very soon, he formed a good relationship with local people. Yet, good times don’t last. In the spring of 1891, a storm of anti-foreign-religion movement was sweeping the area of Yangtze River. Because America had enjoyed judicial privileges and interfered with Chinese internal affairs, Chinese people used all ways to smash churches and chase after or even kill the missionaries as a revolt against foreign dominance. In the end, Charlie had no choice but to take refuge in the Shanghai Concession Area (上海租界區).</p><p> </p><p>On the other hand, the conservative loyalists seemed to take the upper hand in the society. Charlie was anxious to find like-minded people to relieve the nation from suffering. In March of 1894, he met the talented, notable and ambitious young man Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who was dedicated to overthrowing the Qing Court and determined to be the second Hong Xiu-quan (洪秀全), leader of the Taiping Rebellion against the Chinese Qing dynasty. Charlie wanted to follow his footstep to be China’s Washington or Lincoln, who made America strong and prosperous with the Three People’s Principles. He was serious in his attitude and said to Dr. Sun, “If you devote yourself to change the autocracy to freedom, turn sovereignty into civil right, and implement the Three Principles, I’ll stand by and support you forever. I cannot fight in the battle like you do but I can help you behind the scenes. Revolutions need a great amount of money. Let me raise funds and be a contact window with like-minded people secretly.” Dr. Sun, Lu Hao-dong (陸皓東) – one of the revolutionary martyrs who planted the flag of blue sky and white sun— and Charlie swore on the Bible, crying “Destroy the Qing dynasty, restore China, and establish a United Government.” Since then, Charlie started making every effort to assist the work of revolution led by Dr. Sun. In addition to doing business seriously to earn more money, he also went abroad to raise funds in full swing.</p><p>    </p><p>Not long after the Wuchang uprising (武昌起義), on Nov. 3, 1911, the revolutionaries occupied the Jiangnan Manufactory (江南製造局). While all people were overjoyed to witness Shanghai’s recovery, Charlie noticed that a warship with a dragon flag in the Huang-pu River had its cannon aimed at the people on the bank. A blast of cold air sent a shiver all over his body: What if the captain ordered to spit fire? In this critical moment, he landed on a little motor boat and headed for the warship at full speed. After giving his name first, he told Captain Lin Jian-zhong (林建章) what happened in the city and persuaded him to do the right thing – submitting to the revolutionary would be a best choice. Captain Lin gave no answers but  a smile. In the end, the captain lowered the dragon flag while Charlie sighed with relief. This brave act of Charlie’s was just one of the hundred examples he had performed.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie was devoted to not only building the R.O.C. but also being a super father. He trained his kids (three girls and three boys) to endure hunger and extreme cold and to become a problem solver. One day, he brought his 5-year-old girl, Ai-ling (his eldest daughter), outdoors to get soaked in the pouring rain and let her pack up her toys outside the house by herself. He and his wife took turns helping their kids learn to read and write in both Chinese and English. One of the walls in their house was pasted with their kids’ works, including paintings, calligraphy, and some journals. While guests were visiting their house, their kids were always asked to explain the ideas of their arts openly. Naturally, children were thus given chances to train their speech skills and to nurture courage needed for freely expressing themselves. He even helped Ai-ling and other children to arrange a family newspaper. No wonder all of his children had outstanding performances both at home and abroad. 1n 1910, Macon News Paper, Georgia (喬治亞梅肯城日報) presaged in its headlines that Ailing would marry the president in China after she returned home..</p><p>       </p><p>Constantly, Charlie would remind his children to identify with their motherland and loved her forever faithfully. When they first returned to the Chinese home from America, Ai-ling would complain about the drinking water she consumed in China, and Mei-ling would display her resentment as nothing in China could be compared to the U.S. As their conscience, Charlie would admonish them repeatedly, “Our motherland may seem backward, but it nurtures us all. The Chinese may appear ignorant, but they are deeply connected to us in blood and flesh.” Convinced  by him, his lovely daughters all changed their western-style clothing to Chinese dresses; they spoke in Chinese at home and volunteered to participate in social welfare activities. In their early years, Ai-ling and Ching-ling (his second daughter) would follow Charlie’s instruction to hide themselves behind the screen and listen to what their father said to his customers. Later, they were encouraged to work as his secretaries and directly deal with businessmen. That was why Dr. Sun was always so satisfied with them as his secretaries. Both of them were Dr. Sun’s competent secretaries successively. Later, Charlie successfully dissuaded Ai-ling from marrying Dr. Sun, and he had Ching-ling take over the secretary job. Incredibly, Chingling also fell in love with Dr. Sun. She ignored her family’s opposition to their relationship and ran away resolutely with Dr. Sun. Finally, Charlie saw no alternatives; he made concessions and gave the couple a set of delicate furniture and a box of Bibles. How pitiful are the parents who, no matter how heart-broken, simply cannot give up on their children.</p><p>In the early years of the R.O.C., Charlie could do nothing except watching China disintegrated by self-serving warlords and weakened by economic depression; he felt so stressed out that he finally got sick. The rare happy moment occurred when his American friend General Carl visited him in Shanghai in 1917. What Carl saw in China was merely poverty and backwardness. He told Charlie honestly that “China’s future looks bleak.” Charlie answered, “Yes, now it’s poor, but after 100 or 200 years, China will catch up with the U.S. because there are some people like us who don’t want China to fall behind.” The old man held Charlie tightly and said, “Charlie, my dear son. I am so satisfied to have ever helped you. From North Carolina to Shanghai, you’re the seed of God. You’re a miracle created by God. I am so proud of you.”</p><p>     </p><p>On May 3, 1918, having pulsed tenaciously for 55 years, the heart of worrying about his ill-fated nation and suffering people eventually stopped beating. Fortunately, his excellent children—Ai-ling, Ching-ling, Mei-ling, Tzu-wen, Tzu-liang, Tzan – had kept doing well for the goals which he persistently pursued throughout his life. He is really a man of wisdom, mercy and bravery. In all his life, he firmly supported behind the scenes the big revolution business led by Dr. Sun. Charlie Soong indeed deserves the tribute paid by all members of the ROC wholeheartedly.</p>
