<p><strong>Dec. 7, 2013</strong></p><p><strong><em>Jeopardy</em></strong></p><p>One Beijing University student Hu Xiao-nan (胡孝楠) got up at 11:00 a.m. on the 15<sup>th</sup> of March, 2013, only to regret that she had wasted much time when her classmates had studied hard. So she set up a webpage “Beijing University Early Rising Association” (北京大學早起學會) on the Renren.com (人人網站), encouraging everyone to get up early and study hard. Unexpectedly, over a thousand students responded to her clarion call: they got up early to eat breakfast and study together.</p><p>	</p><p>Following the steps of Beijing University, Jilin University (吉林大學) student Chang Tian-yi (張天譯) founded “Jilin University Early Rising Association.” Their slogan is “Hi, Are you still sleeping?” and its platform sets up the register time from 6:00 to 7:30 a.m. If you register after 7:30, the system will tell you, “Success doesn’t belong to those who stay in bed.” Lots of students visited this website trying to win the No. 1 title, which became the first thing to do after they opened their eyes. Then they would get an answer from the website which said, “Good morning, I’m an alarm clock of waking dream. You’re No. X.” With the school’s support, the students who ranked top 100 could get a free cup of bean milk at the school restaurant. Right now, this platform has over 10,000 users. This meaningful campaign is catching fire over college campuses in Mainland China. Shan Dong College (山東大學), Fu Dan University (復旦大學), Sun Yat-sen University (中山大學), Southwest Jiaotong University (西南交通大學)—Students from these schools answered it enthusiastically.</p><p>	</p><p>Bo-jian (伯劍), a PE teacher at 41 from An-Shan Second High School, in Liao-ning Province, had sponsored 46 helpless children to grow up since 1996. Eighteen had graduated from college, while seven of them are still studying at college. Now he takes care of 36 children, whom he arranges to stay separately in three residences. Every morning at 3:30, Bo-jian would pick up all these children from one place to another, have them receive physical training, and drive them first back home for breakfast and then to school. TV host Zhou Li-po marveled, “He’s the greatest man I’ve ever seen. No words could express my admiration for what he has done.”</p><p>	</p><p>With a meager salary of RMB3000, Bo-jian needs to do odd jobs here and there to support these children, such as delivering lunch boxes, or selling shoes, socks or cell phones. From time to time, he would borrow money from his friends and even mortgaged his parents’ old house for a bank loan to pay for five children’s college tuition. His parents, his two sisters, and especially his second sister-in-law, all willingly offer big help to make meals and do other chores for the children. “Being a father,” said Bo-jian, “I enjoy the moments when my children get excited in trying on the new clothes I bought them, when they hug me, and when they give me the prizes they won from competitions.”</p><p>	</p><p>With strong will and perseverance, Bo-jian has trained 20 first-rate and 100 second-rate athletes for his nation. He believes that success doesn’t just emerge suddenly but is the natural outcome of a gradual hard-working process. He has three dreams: First, every child of his shall grow healthily and happily. Second, the parents who left their children behind with him shall give him or the children a call someday. Third, if the national flag is to be raised at the Olympic Games because of the outstanding performance of one of his children, he shall be able to die without regret. His magnanimous act with neither resentment nor repentance so touched all people who learned of his story that they named him “China’s Super Dad” (中國好爸爸).</p><p>	</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the college students here in Taiwan, who are busy cheating at exams, skipping classes and blaming the society or the government for their suffering from pressures or frustrations. We never examine ourselves or hold any gratitude but only bear grudges and protests. Thus, the entire country stops moving forward.</p><p>	</p><p>The most ridiculous thing is that lots of my people are very proud of our products and turn their nose up at things from mainland China. In the traditional market, for example, many stall keepers always guarantee that their products are made from Taiwan, not from China, to reassure their customers. They seem to have forgotten how our businessmen had sabotaged food safety by using plasticizers or producing poisonous flour and cooking oil. Frustratingly and ironically, you go to top hypermarkets or department stores only to find that most high-quality, high-priced products are made by Mainland China. We are so complacent with ourselves that we don’t know what has happened in the outside world.</p><p>	</p><p>In May of 2005, Lenovo China (中國聯想) merged IBM’s notebook computer section and became the leader of PC industry around the world. Naturally, China is the No. 1 competitor among the leading international enterprises. It is rumored that one bank from the Chinese mainland is financially strong enough to buy the ownership of two banks from Taiwan.  </p><p>	</p><p>People outside Taiwan either study or work hard to dedicate themselves to their society or nation but we just waste our energy in internal strife and power struggle. Others take big strides for self-improvement while we get stuck and exhausted by friction between racial or political factions. Massive amounts of foreign capital are flowing to the Chinese market for hard-won investment opportunities while we, with false pride, insist to look down upon China, opposing it insensibly and incessantly. Alas, if we don’t start adjusting our mentality and working hard and honestly, we shall soon lose all our vantage points and competitiveness, and lag far behind among world economies.</p>
