<p><strong>Feb. 15, 2013</strong></p><p><strong><em>Luckily, We Live Here</em></strong></p><p>One of my high school classmates who lives in St. Mary of Maryland in the U.S.A. called and wished me a happy Lunar New Year a few days ago. During the conversation, she complained about some problems caused by the century’s heaviest snow storm, Nemo, in early February. The long-time power failure and water shortage gave rise to the severe inconvenience in her daily life. Last summer, a student of mine, Steve, who graduated from the St. Virginia Military Institute, went to New York to visit his friends but unfortunately, he ran into the huge hurricane, Sandy. It was the summer at its hottest ever. The power-cut and water-cut made him feel like living in hell. He constantly asked himself, “Is it America? Is it really America?” It was much different from the America where he had studied decades ago. I can’t help asking: Could Taiwan endure such a difficult and poor condition, especially those who live in the big cities? Maybe we will scream at the authorities to our heart’s content.</p><p>On the second or third day of the Lunar New Year, I watched the TV show named “Happiness Is Shining on Me” (幸福照過來), hosted by Cheng Hong-yi (鄭弘儀). When discussing the issue of health insurance, one of the guests Ruan Mu-hua (阮慕華) said that one of his American friends paid an insurance premium of $20,000, and another of his friends announced bankruptcy right after he checked out from the hospital, which charged him a big sum of money, nearly $600 per day for his 10-day hospitalization. That was why many people who had immigrated to the U.S. in their young age returned to Taiwan. One of my friends Judy took a trip to the U.S. with her family a few years ago. She had to send her son to the hospital because he had a serious vomit on the way. To her great astonishment, her son’s medical treatment cost her $10,000 within just a few hours. How horrible.</p><p>Last year, my two-month-old grandson got a complication of a respiratory infection. Our home doctor suggested that we send him to a big hospital with special equipment for babies under six months. Unbelievably, our baby had stayed in Guotai (國泰) Hospital for one week long, but the hospital charged us only over NT$2,000, including intensive care unit and medical expense. Afterwards, we just paid NT$100 for his follow-up diagnosis and treatment every time. This is one of the government’s measures to encourage young couples to give birth to babies and take care of children under three years old.</p><p>I feel really lucky to live in Taiwan. We have high quality national health insurance services, and convenient and clean transportation systems such as MRT, THSR(高鐵), and TRA(台鐵). Most government officials serve people well. Our tax and utility bills are much lower than those of other countries. My son’s family of four people in Vancouver pay their utility bills around CAD$300 a month, roughly equal to NT$10,000. One of my best friends lives only with her husband in L.A., but the authorities charged them US$200 for their monthly water and electricity bills. Can you imagine that?</p><p>The practice of Keeping Trash Off the Ground is another kind of amazement in Taiwan. When in Germany trash is collected only once a week, we here in Taiwan dump our garbage every day to the garbage vehicle. Public restrooms are clean and neat almost everywhere in Taiwan now. A number of elegant parks are filled with green grass, tall trees, and beautiful flowers, and children’s playgrounds are often seen nearby. Thousands of miles of bicycle paths and two round-the-island highways make Taiwan one of the world’s best travel attractions. We are so lucky to live here. We should give ourselves applause since we certainly do not reap without sowing. </p>
