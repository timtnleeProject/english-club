<p><strong>May 14, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>Guei-lin Landscape</em></strong></p><p>For my virgin visit to Mainland China, I chose Guei-lin as my first stop for her picturesque scenery. It proved that the landscape did not let me down during the five-day journey.</p><p>The connected mountains and the inverted reflection in water impressed me most. I felt I was part of the picture while sailing on a bamboo raft and fiddling with the broad and gentle river. Karst features a fine spectacle in Guei-lin and Yang-shou: rain water has flown throughout multi million years and created many peculiar grottos full of rocks in whatever shapes you can name by using your imagination.</p><p>Especially amazing is the show "Impression San-jie Liu." In this on-location performance to feature the landscape in Guei-lin, hundreds of actors gathered on Li River in various kinds of boats to perform different stories, altogether directed by the renowned stage and movie director Chang Yi-mo. The show has broadened my vision greatly.</p><p>Although there are many marvelous views in the Chinese mainland, I feel reluctant to visit there again. I hate the deceitful manner of people there. For example, the couriers offered higher money exchange rate to the tourist group members with sl wordings; the businessmen showed the high-quality sample but sold the low-quality product. Such ugly human nature makes me sick and disappointed, and I have certainly learned how to take necessary precautions against mainland Chinese people.</p>
