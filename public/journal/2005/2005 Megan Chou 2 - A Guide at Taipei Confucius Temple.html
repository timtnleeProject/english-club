<p><strong>Apr. 15, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Guide at Taipei Confucius Temple</em></strong></p><p>I am fond of taking field trips offered by my son's class, because there is always a guide to introduce the visiting spot.</p><p>This time we visited Taipei Confucius Temple. That morning, we were 20 minutes late when we arrived there. I saw an angry-eyed man walk toward me and ask loudly, "Are you with the students of Mu-Cha Elementary School?" I answered "Yes" with fright! The senior, with his authoritative tone, appeared really different from those guides I had met before.</p><p>Patiently, he led us for the tour inside the temple, and introduced its architecture and its embodied spirit in terms of paleography, which reminded me of what I had learned at high school. The most impressive description is about the "Hong Gate," the entrance of the temple. The upper part of the gate is an arch, often associated with the circle we draw with compasses; the lower part shapes as part of a square. In Chinese, we call a pair of compasses a <em>yuan-quei</em>, while a square <em>ju-hsing</em>, and <em>kuei</em> and <em>ju</em> come together to mean "moral principles." And so, whenever people pass through the gate, they will be admonished against violating Confucius' teaching.</p>
