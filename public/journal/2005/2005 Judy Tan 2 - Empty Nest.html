<p><strong>April. 11, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>Empty Nest</em></strong></p><p>Empty nests are the problem for us over forty. Unfortunately one of my friends Gloria must face it before forty. It really bothered her because her two daughters made the decision to study and live far away from home and her husband has to work in another city. "It almost gets me mad when I face the empty house." She told me. "You can do anything you like, isn't it good? Do not be silly to quit your job." I answered.</p><p>It is useless for her. It is true that the parents are relying on their children deeply. It makes us panic when the little birds grow up and then fly away from the nest naturally. We just have no choice but to accept.</p><p>How can we deal with our elderly parents' life without the joy of lovely children? The empty nest is the problem. Who will accompany you? There is nobody but the servants you spend the money for will beside you. It is a big problem if you have just no money then. It is the best way to keep good friends, enough money, your partner and good health with you in the empty nest.</p>
