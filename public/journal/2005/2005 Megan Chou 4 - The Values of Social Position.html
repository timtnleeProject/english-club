<p><strong>Aug. 15, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Values of Social Position</em></strong></p><p>You will be admired for having a good job title or working in a magnificent industry, although your salary is not as good as your title. No one cares how much money you actually earn except yourself. Or, you could be praised because you dare to abandon a well-paid job and choose a quiet rural life to become a hermit. The most miserable thing is that you are too young to retire although you are rich enough. Most people will look down upon you for you have accomplished nothing. Finally, you will lose yourself again, because you cannot ignore the slighting attitude of your friends or relatives.</p><p>I strongly believe that human life should be colorful, wonderful. Although certain basic life responsibilities should be taken, chasing continuously the gloriousness and interests of life is important, too. If you just follow the ways people expect you to do, I doubt what fun you can get. Maybe you will feel disappointed with nothing left at the end of life except complaints. Is it worthwhile?</p><p>A couple of my friends were embarrassed by a similar situation recently. The husband received a pretty good layoff fee and desired to live a comfortable lifestyle with his wife (no routine work, waking after a satisfactorily good sleep, and going on travels all the time) but his wife did not like the kind of leisure life. She wanted her husband to go looking for an easy job, not only for a regular income but also for the value of living. The wife needed much sense of security and cared about the social judgments. She came up with many reasons to persuade her husband, but her husband also defended himself with strong arguments. I suspect the couple will have a long way to go before they could compromise with each other now that they seem to have very different views on life.</p>
