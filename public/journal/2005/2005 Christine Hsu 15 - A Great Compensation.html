<p><strong>Dec. 16, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>A Great Compensation</em></strong></p><p>I had been hearing that the government would build a swimming pool to compensate our neighborhood for being so near the incinerator. After nine long years, the recreation center finally opened on November 5. Besides a swimming pool in the basement, they also offered a kids' playground and a reading room on the first and second floors respectively.</p><p>The good news was not spread out until these last two weeks. I had been worried that too many swimmers would deteriorate the quality of water, but to my great surprise, the water is kept clean all the time. All the employees there are very nice and polite, much better than those of the other swimming pools I used to visit. The only defect is that the water for the shower is not always hot enough, especially when many people are using it.</p><p>Before I get into the pool, they will check my ID and I have to fill up a brief application form for insurance to write down my name, ID number and birth date. I've visited lots of swimming pools, but this is the first time I get such special service. And they also supply shower gel. How thoughtful they are! My kids and I all enjoy their enthusiastic services and complete facilities.</p><p>Though this pool is a little bit small and narrow, I am still grateful to be able to use it. I secretly hope that all residents nearby will cherish it by using it properly.</p>
