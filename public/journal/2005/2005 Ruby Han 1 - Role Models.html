<p><strong>June 9, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>Role Models</em></strong></p><p>Jennifer is my role model because she is always able to give me a good answer to whatever question I ask about English. Not only do I have a poor memory, but I also do things carelessly. She, however, carefully corrects each sentence I have written every time. I think doing things seriously is why she handles English so well.</p><p>Confucius taught all kinds of students who wished to learn. I guess my dear Teacher Jennifer is very much like him. We are really a group of lucky people to be able to be her students.</p><p>The second role model of mine is Rose, who is an excellent English teacher, too, and has a good taste in food and clothes. She is such a super fan of Jackie Chan that she even went to one of his concerts in Hong Kong. Although she looks like a yuppie, everyone admires her for her hard work, honesty, kindness and, of course, her fashionable style. A very humble and careful person, she always abides by law.  She hands in all test papers on time and attends every meeting, including the flag-raising ceremony every other day at school. She crosses the road by taking the zebra-crossing and following the traffic light. Rose has embodied the valuable virtues rarely found in our society.</p><p>Rose is also an animal lover. Her elderly pet dog has an eye disease (glaucoma) and cannot see things very clearly. Every morning, Rose needs to hold her dog and go downstairs with tissues and a bottle of water to deal with its excrement. And then she will walk her for a while. After all is finished, she will hold her half-blind dog and get upstairs to the fourth floor. It's really hard work for Rose, but she has been doing it for many years.</p><p>Beforeher her retirement, nearly every day Rose needed to help her students -- especially the suicide-prone ones -- solve all kinds of problems. She never left school until 5 pm; in contrast, most other senior high school teachers stayed away from school when they had no classes, knowing that the school demanded all teachers to stay in school all day, with or without classes.</p><p>    </p><p>Now, Rose has retired. Due to her capability and her moral character, she was elected as a director-general of the Taipei First Girls’ Senior High School Retired Faculty Association. Besides arranging and helping a variety of get-together activities, she was also in charge of a group for the appeal against the public annuity reform to defend the retired teachers’ rights. The process of each pleading case was difficult and tedious. However, never had she got tired of explaining again and again every small detail about how to fill out the application form, how to make the table comparing the pensions before and after the reform,  and how many documents the applicants need to hand in; never had she stopped searching online or by phone the retired teachers who lost contact; and never had she quit helping the applicants with checking or revising all forms to be submitted. Finally, the huge work was finished within months. What a great woman with tremendous courage and careful thoughts. A common saying best describes Rose: "A great person chooses a rough road to walk on and takes up the heaviest responsibility."</p>
