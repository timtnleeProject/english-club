<p><strong>April 8, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Different Concepts</em></strong></p><p>After sending my husband, Kevin, to take the bus to the CKS Airport, on the way home, I was lost in thought about the previous conversation between Kevin and me. The day before, when I wanted to withdraw money from his bank account for monthly household expenditure, I found the bank balance was insufficient. On the way to the bus station, I asked him why he needed more money than what I had given him--the amount of US dollars he demanded for the use abroad. He explained that he would pay the accommodation fee by cash to avoid the loss caused by the appreciation of RMB. I reluctantly accepted it but could not believe that he was going to exchange the money at the airport. Everyone knew that to buy US dollars at the airport was much more expensive than in a bank. Before I changed the money days ago, I had checked two banks for the exchange rate. I felt it a complete waste of energy and time for me to try to save such a small amount of money while Kevin actually cared little about it. Due to our different concepts of money, everything related to money could make me unhappy.</p><p>The uncomfortable feeling took my thought back to the third day of Chinese Lunar New Year when we had dinner at my parents-in-law's. Kevin talked volubly with his family about his plan to study at Zhejiang University. I remained silent while listening to each one of them admiring the wonderful educational system in Mainland China. The more they talked, the more I felt isolated. It seemed that none of them thought it irresponsible of Kevin to leave us behind to study in China. My sister-in-law even said that it was good to have Kevin pave the way for her kids. Later, they also talked about Taiwan's deteriorating educational system and its rotten government. From their conversation I could tell how disappointed they felt at this island we live on. I murmured to myself, "Why did they only see the negative side?" I felt depressed listening to their criticism. I found they and I had different political ideologies and different views about China.</p><p>That very night, Kevin decided to go back to his hometown, Wen-chou, with his father for the Tomb Sweeping Festival. With a tight schedule of work and school, I did not think he could make it. But I was proved wrong. I also realized that apparently Kevin yielded to most of my opinions, but he was tough on whatever he was determined to do. I don't think Kevin and I will make any changes in the future. I have to manage to accept the differences between us so as to prevent frequent quarrels and further conflicts. But the bottom line for concession is that the kids should be the top priority of all concerns.</p>
