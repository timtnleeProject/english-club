<p><strong>Dec. 2, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Whether to Get a Part-time Job or Not</em></strong></p><p>About two weeks ago, it suddenly occurred to me that maybe I should find a part-time job, as I felt bored doing house chores and charity volunteer work.</p><p>Last Friday morning, I went to have my key duplicated. It had been a long time since I last visited the shop, but the two brothers who ran it still remembered me, especially the elder one who had checked my palm to predict my future in our first meeting. He had said that my life would be much better in my late 30s. I asked him if what he had predicted remained the same.</p><p>The answer was yes. He strongly suggested that I get a job as he had advised me many years ago. According to my physiognomy and palm prints, he said that I would have great achievement at work. He thought it was a pity for me to work for charity foundations where I could earn a sense of achievement only, but not money.</p><p>His words kept pounding in my head. It strengthened my thought of finding a job. I began to talk about it with friends these days. Working at a supermarket or a coffee shop would be a good choice. But after checking more related details, I found that I had to work not only during weekdays, but also on weekends. It frustrated me extremely.</p><p>Thinking that I might not find an ideal part-time job, I had been in a very bad mood until this Tuesday morning. I met a volunteer worker as well as a good friend of mine in Tzu Chi. She was running a trade company for many years and recently she planned to move her office to downtown Taipei from Tamsui. Now she got an employee who worked from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and she planned to hire a part-time secretary so as to expand her business. She fervently welcomed me to work with her, which boosted my confidence in finding a suitable job again.</p><p>For the past two weeks, my mind had been troubled by one single thought. I got stuck in the thought and could hardly do anything, not even my favorite thing--chatting on the Internet. The only thing I did much was sleep. How can a thought bother me so much? On second thought, I feel I am such a blessed person that I can always do something new to make my life colorful. My husband Kevin said that even though he did not like his job, he still had to do it. I should enjoy and cherish the leisure life I have now. The job suitable for me now is taking good care of my family.</p>
