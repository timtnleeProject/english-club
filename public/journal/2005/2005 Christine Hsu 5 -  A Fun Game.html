<p><strong>April 29, 2005 </strong></p><p><strong> <em>A Fun Game</em></strong></p><p>Since last year, the Wenshan self-help group has provided two shows for the activities of Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation (NCF). We had performed two sign-language songs, so this time we would like to try something different. The daughter of one of our members suggested we play a game that she had seen on the TV show. The game had kids, with their eyes covered and with plugs tied to their chests, walk through a certain distance to plug in the sockets tied to the belly of their own mother or father. With rousing music, we believed this show would delight all audiences. We planned to not only play it among ourselves, but also invite some audiences to have fun with us. Surprisingly, we had more participants than the number of gifts we had prepared.</p><p>The first problem we encountered was that we could not find the plugs and sockets but had to make them by ourselves. Luckily, one of our members managed to get a sample. Two members and I used Styrofoam to make two sets and covered them with red tapes. It took us three hours to finish just two sets. All of us took pride in the amazing properties we had made.</p><p>When the day was coming, all of us were excited but worried that no one would attend our game. After our performance, a heap of kids and parents lined up to join in. We even did not have enough volunteers to serve all participants. They kept lining up even though all the gifts had been sent out. At the end, we unexpectedly changed the rules and invited husbands and wives to join in. We particularly prepared a special gift for the winner. Different from previous games, they drew lots to decide where to tie their plugs and sockets. It did make the game more interesting and exciting. It was funny to see those couples with the plugs and sockets on their backs, hips or bellies. When the music "We Will We Will Rock you" came out from the loud speaker, all wives with the plugs quickly ran toward their husbands to plug in the sockets and then posed in triumph.</p><p>To our great surprise, this game caused a sensation on that day, but before we went there, an unpleasant incident happened. One of our members suddenly informed us that her husband could not go with us. This couple joined our group two years ago. Because some of our members did not have cars, we had always needed help from them with their 7-seat van to give NCF members a ride. But they had never done it even once and this was the third time they stood us up. I not only had to re-arrange the transportation for those members without their own cars, but also had to dissuade them from condemning her. I knew their personalities well enough not to blame her. I just felt sorry for the inconveniences she caused us as well as the loss of our faith and trust in her.</p>
