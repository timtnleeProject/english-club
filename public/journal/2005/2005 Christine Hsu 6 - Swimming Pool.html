<p><strong>May 6, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Swimming Pool</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>No sport is more relaxing and enjoyable than swimming. To the best of my knowledge, there is no exercise other than swimming in which we can do alone without streaming with sweat. Furthermore, the swimming pool is the best place for one to get calm and then to think.  This is why I love swimming so much.</p><p>Eight years ago I was a member of a health club and swam almost every day for three years. One day, I punctually arrived there as usual, only to find it closed down. I lost some money on club membership, but I got more than I lost because my swimming skill had improved a lot in that club.</p><p>With the help of some strangers and friends, I can finally swim four styles. I enjoy the ease of backstroke, the speed of freestyle, the floating feeling of breaststroke and the flying sensation of butterflies. The flip is what I like to do in the pool when I reach one end from the other side. But it has taken me plenty of time to learn how to do it. One year ago, before doing the flip, I had to slow down to make sure that my feet could reach the wall after flipping. Now I can keep swimming fast and do it without a pause. After the flip, I will dive into the pool and quickly do some dolphin kicks to swim out of the water and then enjoy taking a deep breath after a long distance dive.</p><p>In the swimming pool, sometimes I like to think about some tough issue that I cannot concentrate on when I am at home, or I will study each stroke to find the best way to swim faster but easier. Even a little bit of progress would cheer me up for a long time.</p><p>For most people, swimming is the best exercise but it is not easy to find a clean pool with cheap admission. Every year, the Government would examine the water quality of all swimming pools but find many unqualified, some of which actually belonged to 5-star hotels. It would damage our health to swim in such pools. Too much use of chemicals is not the only cause of the problem; swimmers' failure to follow strictly the rule of taking showers before entering the pool certainly helps contaminate the water. I always feel insecure to swim in a turbid pool.</p><p>Despite its drawbacks, swimming remains my favorite sport. Learning it is like learning English; the more you learn, the more you feel the need to learn. It would never bore you.</p>
