<p><strong>May 27, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>When the Dream Comes True</em></strong></p><p>Was it not the dream I wanted most to travel abroad again? Why did I not feel thrilled when I planned for the 10-day tour at the beginning? Why was a road to happiness strewn with setbacks?</p><p>One month ago, a call from my sister-in-law brought me great news that they would extend the summer camp for children to eight days this year. It used to last five days in the past four years. Last year I had joined it with my kids as a volunteer worker but working there really bored me. Most volunteers only worked but never talked. After enduring five silent days, I decided not to join it ever again. So this year, as soon as I got the good news, I told my husband and began to plan a trip for the two of us.</p><p>I had picked up several Korean guests for the Tzu-Chi Foundation in the past two years, so I decided to visit Korea as it would not cost me much to spend a vacation there and after that I might have more topics to talk with the next Korean marrow courier. Once I began to search the information by surfing on the Internet or asking friends who had visited there, I had been getting more disappointment than joy. None of my friends recommended that I go there and all information showed that winter was the best season for sightseeing.  One of my best friends even told me that she had regretted visiting Korea as soon as she arrived at the Korean International Airport several years ago. All these negative responses forced me to change my planned destination. An ideal place occurred to me, the Netherlands, which had not been in my plan simply because of the great expense to travel there. </p><p>"Why go to Korea just because it is cheaper than going to the Netherlands? It is like attending to the trifles but neglecting the essentials." My husband said with unbelieving looks. "You should go to Holland. Do not care too much about money," he added. His encouragement and support determined me to spend my rare holidays in Holland.</p><p>Thinking about the food, beverages and movies I was going to enjoy, I began to expect the coming trip. I could not wait to tell Isabel, a friend of mine married to a Dutch last year. With the help of the Internet, we thoroughly discussed our schedule via some messenger program without one single international call. Needless to say, we got all the information we needed on the Internet. How amazing that I could know how to get to all the attractive places in Holland without stepping out of my living room.</p><p>The great expense of this trip made me sleepless for several days, but with my family's understanding and Isabel's helpfulness, I knew this would be another wonderful trip after my last one to Melbourne, even though it may not be the best season to visit Holland at this time of the year.</p>
