<p><strong>Sep. 09, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>The Marrow Courier</em></strong></p><p>Since last March I have received about 16 marrow couriers. During the last two months I have helped five couriers, which is the first time I have helped so many within such a short time. At the beginning, I didn't really like doing this job, which I worried might cost me a great deal, but the more I did it, the more I liked it. From talking with these people, I got to know about their native countries. I gradually enjoyed helping them more and felt blessed that I could have the rare chance to make friends with them.</p><p>People from all over the world took bone marrow from Tzu-Chi Hospital, but Terry was the first one that had come from South Africa. When we picked her up, the other volunteer was driving so I could concentrate on talking to Terry. She kept telling me how she admired our foundation and what we had done for those suffering people. I was surprised to hear that in South Africa, people could not have bone marrow transplants at the public hospital because there were too many AIDS patients. Fortunately, some wealthy people helped build a hospital to take care of impoverished people. This was the hospital Terry worked for. After visiting the Jing-si Hall in Hualien, she learned that Tzu-Chi had built some elementary schools in her country and she was eager to visit those schools back home. This was the first time I talked so much about Tzu-Chi with a marrow courier, as well as the first time I got a thank-you card with considerably sweet words from a marrow courier.</p><p>In April I failed to receive a Canadian marrow courier because she had changed her schedule and taken an earlier plane, so I was more cautious and prayed sincerely this time. Laura and I had an enjoyable chat in my car. We talked about her trip in Taiwan as well as her daughters’ vacation in Asia and France. To my great surprise, her elder daughter was a coach for training lifesavers. All members of her family were good at swimming and they had a cottage just beside a famous lake in Canada. Every summer they would go there to swim. How wonderful! I did envy her. She was so nice to give me a book about the attractions of the province she lived in.</p><p>I was so excited when I knew that I would need to pick up an English woman. It would be great to share with her my travel experiences in Holland. Hazel was a very talkative person like me. We even talked about birth, sickness, old age and death. The magazine of Studio Classroom happened to introduce London in its August issue so I got the chance to ask her more related details. As she had worked in Holland a few years ago we got a lot of things to share. Before she left, she told me that one of her colleagues, Greg, would come soon. Greg happened to be the guest I was assigned to pick up the next time.</p><p>Since we never know ahead which marrow courier we will pick up, meeting Greg to me was not only a coincidence but also a very special affinity. Greg arrived last Saturday and I was assigned to send him to Songshan Airport from the hotel this Monday. On Sunday evening he did not have any set plans so I took him to Longshan Temple. When we arrived there, I was surprised to find that it was the first day of the lunar month. We saw hundreds of people bend their knees to worship by reading the sutra. Greg kept saying, “The timing is perfect!” He was impressed by this scene and took lots of pictures. It is said that “without visiting the snake alley, the trip in Taipei would not be complete.” At the snake alley, I found a small shop selling the desserts Beigang is famous for. We had hot rice dumpling (燒麻糬) and glutinous rice porridge (糯米粥). Besides these, he also tasted other famous desserts at the Wanhua night market. Afterward, I took him to Bitan in Hindi. I had never known that the scene over the bridge could be so bright and beautiful at night. From his email I got yesterday, I could tell that he had enjoyed that evening. I was surprised that such a little gift from me would overwhelm him so much.</p><p>When I had noodles with Greg, he shared something interesting with me. The Italians always roll a mouthful of spaghetti with forks and put all of it into their mouths as they thought it was impolite to drop the noodle. Even little kids could do it perfectly. It seems they are born with such amazing ability. Greg also told me that he had been to many countries to get bone marrow, but this was the first time he had someone to receive him. Usually, he had to go to the hospital all by himself. After visiting Tzu-Chi’s headquarters and the Abode in Hualien, he said he enjoyed the picturesque mountains and ocean, the friendly Tzu-Chi people and the smiling Master. He said that he never expected Taiwan to be such a beautiful place with so many special people. With all Tzu-Chi volunteers’ enthusiasm and helpfulness, I think we have successfully improved Taiwan’s diplomacy in an unofficial way.</p><p>I didn’t know until last Sunday, besides Greg, I also had a German guest. He and Greg took the same plane to Hualien on Monday. It was the first time for me to receive male marrow couriers, and two at a time. We took a picture together at Songshan Airport in memory of such a rare occasion to be appreciated.</p><p>It was like traveling to four countries after receiving these five marrow couriers.  I felt so content and happy. Though all of them have gone back to their home, I know this is just the beginning of new friendship no matter if we will have the chance to meet each other ever again.</p>
