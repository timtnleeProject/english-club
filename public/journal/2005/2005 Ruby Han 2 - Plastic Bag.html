<p><strong>June 23, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>Plastic Bag</em></strong></p><p>For many years I have tried hard to avoid taking plastic bags offered by shop clerks or peddlers because I know the plastic bag does not decay easily but can be preserved for over hundreds of years. Whenever I go out, I always bring along some folded plastic bags.</p><p>I like to put all the purchased goods in one bag instead of in many different bags. If we save two bags a day, we will be able to save 60 bags a month. How much plastic trash can we reduce in a year? If we love Taiwan, we will do it despite its inconvenience.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it's a little difficult to do such a "stupid" thing. If you want to reuse the plastic bags, you need to keep them clean and dry first, or they will get a bad smell. It is comparatively too convenient to simply take a new bag provided by the store from where we buy things.</p><p>Christine had done that "stupid" but meaningful thing for a long time. While we got together at my home last Friday, she and Susanna taught us how to fold the plastic bags into a triangle or a square or even a knot. In this way, they are easy to carry. It may seem trivial but it does awful good to the environment we live in.</p><p>Not only plastic bags, paper bags also damage our environment. The more we use the paper bags, the more trees will be cut off. Destroying the forest is one of the main causes for the earth to become worse than ever. Furthermore, if we take a lot of bags home, they will take up our already limited space in our house. Bringing along our own bags when doing purchases has great advantages but costs little trouble. Why don't we do it?</p>
