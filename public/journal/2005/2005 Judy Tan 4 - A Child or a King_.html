<p><strong>Sep. 3, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Child or a King?</em></strong></p><p><em>  </em>                      </p><p>Recently I have read a news article where a teacher talked about the great care a student's mother took of her child. Every day the mother not only sends the lunch box to her child but also peels off fruits and cuts them into pieces for her child, almost like serving a king. When the school was holding a camp to teach children how to live independently by themselves, the child's mother brought along a new tent and helped her child's group set it up. She even cooked for her dear child's group before she went back home. Surely this mother loves her child, but it seems unbearably overwhelming. I believe all parents hope their children grow up strongly, but if we do whatever children can do themselves, we are just depriving children of the chance and right to learn.</p><p>One teacher told us that parents should stand BEFORE children when they are under about 12 years old, BY them in their junior high, and BEHIND them when they are in college. It means when children are still little we take great care of them but when they grow up gradually, we must comprehend that they have become individuals and we must let go. It is you who gave birth to your children, but it doesn't mean they owe you, or you own them.</p><p>Needless to say we all love our children very much but it does not mean we need to do everything for them. Some parents complain about the laziness of their grown up children but they forget how they used to educate their children, how they kept telling their children, "You don't need to do any household chores. Just pay attention to your studies and try to get good grades." It won't be a problem if your children are to become kings or queens, but it will be if they stay being a commoner. For who is to serve them when you no longer do?</p>
