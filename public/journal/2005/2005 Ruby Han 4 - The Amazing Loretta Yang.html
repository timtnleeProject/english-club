<p><strong>June 11, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Amazing Loretta Yang</em></strong></p><p>Loretta Yang got two Golden Horse awards and one Asia-Pacific award for best actress in 1984 and 1985. Whenever the films required her to do some dangerous action, she never hesitated to jump from a five-story building or run through the fire in person. She even gained 22 kilograms in six weeks for playing a pregnant woman and recovered her slender figure in another six weeks to attend the Golden Horse award handout ceremony.</p><p>When she was on the top of her career, she wanted to try something new. After Loretta found the beautiful crystal, one of the 19th century French arts, she decided to commit herself to it.</p><p>In 1987, she and her husband, Chang Yi, established their workshop to create crystal art by the method of so-called "lost wax." Because she had little experience in it, the firing kilns and crystal art works in the making were damaged by the over-high temperature. She rebuilt those kilns at the cost of NT$200,000-500,000 each. She "burned out" all of their property and houses, and made a big loan of NT$180,000,000 with an interest rate of NT$25,000,000 per year. Finally, she went to New York to learn about some of the skills of "lost wax." After one year and a half, she returned to Tamsui to work again. She was fully committed. As her husband described, "being a stubborn person, she has kept going ahead without ever turning back, and she has made it at last."</p><p>Actually, her persevering quality set her on the path to success. Sometimes she kept working with clay at her workshop all by herself for about 15 to 90 days. She said, "It's comforting and it's worth it to search out the right facial expression of Buddha. I've checked all the Buddha figures from ancient to modern days that have appeared in the books of Buddha, including the Japanese versions." She hardly felt the pain while the hot crystal liquid splashed on her body or hands by accident. Because of her hard and long-time work, she had a pair of rough hands, which astonished many people when they shook hands with her.</p><p>She has made a name for herself as a stand-out crystal artist and become the focus of international attention since 1990. She now owns 59 galleries around the world and the turnover reaches NT$800,000,000. Many foreign countries had invited her over to give exhibitions. One piece of her art named "Silent Beauty" became the permanent collection of France National Sevres Museum. Also, her series of arts named "Blossoming Flowers and Full Moon" and "No Shape" impressed the spectators so deeply that France Capazza gallery earnestly asked her to extend her exhibition from less than two months to two years.</p><p>Despite her remarkable achievement, she allowed her husband to do all the talking. When she faced the media, she always held his hand with a smile and said, "All he said was right," or "We share the same idea." They got together every day and every minute for nearly 20 years. Loretta said, "The colorful clouds scatter easily and the dazzling crystal is fragile, so I need to pay greater attention to our marriage."</p>
