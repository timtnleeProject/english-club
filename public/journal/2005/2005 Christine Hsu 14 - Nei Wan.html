<p><strong>Dec. 9, 2005  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Nei Wan</em></strong></p><p>Last Saturday, when I woke up and found it was raining, I prayed immediately that the rain would stop as soon as we had planned one month ago to go to Nei Wan with my husband's siblings. I would hate the rain to spoil our fun.</p><p>The weather was getting better on the way to Nei Wan and when we arrived there, the warm sunshine took off our heavy coats. It was only 9 a.m. With few tourists in the town we could quickly walk through the old town and enjoy various Hakka foods.</p><p>When we bargained with one seller who did not know that I was a Hakka, she said as long as one of us could say some Hakka, she would give us a five percent discount. I began to chat with her and finally she realized that Hakka was my mother tongue.</p><p>It was the second time I visited the small town, but I had never been to the Lover Valley. From that hill, I could view the whole town. The scenery was fabulous. And the clear air refreshed all of us. When we were back to the town, it was filled up with thousands of tourists.</p><p>On the way to Nei Wan, we passed an old station called He-Sing Station, famous for a love story that has been handed down since 1959. A teenage boy lived at the foot of He-Sing Station and had to take the train to school from that station every morning. One day, he woke up so late that he might miss the final examination and failed to graduate together with the girl he adored. Thinking of this, he decided to chase the train. After running laboriously for two kilometers, he finally caught the train at the next station. The story ended happily: He married the girl and they lived happily ever after.</p><p>After lunch, we experienced one Hakka tea culture of so-called Ray-Cha. First of all, we grinded peanuts with white and black sesame and then mixed them in green tea powder. We stirred the material with hot water and added some red beans and tiny desserts made of rice. It was so delicious and only the two bowls of it made us full. Though my husband, two daughters and I had had it several times, we still enjoyed it as much as the rest of the party, who experienced it the first time. All of us felt interested in this rare experience.</p>
