<p><strong>Nov. 25, 2005</strong></p><p><strong><em>Some Thoughts about Life</em></strong></p><p>Few people know what life really is. And fewer people are aware that they should seek the truth of it. Most people live their lives one day after another till their death. Without knowing what exactly they are doing, they suffer and enjoy happiness blindly. And so we may say the majority of people are drunk, not sober even for a single second.</p><p>Of course I am one the drunk, too. And I also do not know clearly what life is. However, I believe that I have the potential to become sober someday as long as I follow the footprints of the awakened.</p><p>According to what I have read, most people are not sober, unable to be their own masters, and therefore they suffer during their lifetime. They (including myself) live in a dualistic world, which is created by human speculation. In the dualistic world, there exist GOOD and BAD, RIGHT and WRONG, BIG and SMALL, LIKE and HATE, FOR and AGAINST. . . . People see the world according to their own viewpoints, opinions, preferences, prejudices, and biases. Among various opinions on the same thing, which is right? Duality is created by people's discrimination, illusion, and attachment. If we learn from the awakened, we will have the possibilities to transcend the dualistic world.</p><p>Why must we transcend the duality, or the dichotomy? As I mentioned previously, duality is illusory in nature, not the eternal truth. Any phenomenon in the universe is neutral. It is our thought that gives it meaning. There is no duality or originally. You cannot see what life really is without going beyond the duality. You cannot be really sober without reaching beyond the duality. As long as the duality exists, there will be no real harmony, peace, and happiness. It is impossible for you to hold GOOD and avoid BAD forever. But it is possible to reach beyond GOOD and BAD, which state, I believe, is even much better than GOOD.</p><p>How can we transcend duality? Just follow the footprints of the awakened. The awakened are the Buddha and many other saints, who see the world as it really is, without prejudice or illusion, giving no tag or attachment onto anything. Therefore, they enjoy true harmony, peace, liberation, and happiness. They have already stepped outside of the delusive dualistic world (in which almost everyone on earth is living.</p><p>And how can we be as wise as they?</p><p>In order to be a hundred percent awake, we must practice the methods (such as insight meditation) as taught by saints in the Buddha Sutra. By doing so, we may purify our mind, terminate our fixed habitual mental responses, and understand the meaning of life.</p><p>To understand what duality is is one thing, and to walk out of it is quite another. I seem to have seen through duality, but in my heart I still have dualistic attachment. I still cling to what I think is good, and reject what I think is bad. I still get involved in the dualistic trap, and I either suffer illusory sadness or enjoy transitory, conditioned happiness.</p><p>So after knowing it, one should "perform" the awakening.</p><p>May everybody in the world become sober one way or another, or at least be aware of the fact that they are not sober at all.</p>
