<p><strong>Mar. 7, 2023        </strong></p><p><strong><em>It’s Unfair    </em></strong></p><p>When homicides are committed, murderers are often called the beasts in human clothing. No, it’s so untrue. And it’s unfair, too: beasts are much less cruel and are hardly evil.</p><p>In Keelung of 1922, a drunk mutton hot pot restaurant owner killed one of his regular customers. He cut the victim’s dead body into lumps, put some of them into the mutton hot pot for cooking, and served the dish to other customers. </p><p>In 1998, a graduate from National Tsing Hua University killed her rival in love and then chopped up her corpse with Wang Shui (王水), a deadly mixture of nitric acid (硝酸) and hydrochloric acid (鹽酸).</p><p>Recently, the most sensational conversation topic among the Chinese circle is about the murder of Abby Choi, a Hong Kong model and influencer. She was believed to have been dismembered by her ex-husband, his brother, and his parents. People are shocked by the cruel act, considering the rumor that she had financially supported her ex-husband’s entire family for years.</p><p>In Tainan of 2015, there happened the infamous illegal burial of stainless steel slags (爐渣). The greedy lawless businessmen disregarded people’s health and buried the slags beneath the farmlands, fish farms, streams, industrial lands, and public lands. Over years, they had buried 680,000 tons of slags and earned a profit as high as US$2.1 billion at the expense of diseased corns, cadmium-polluted rice, chrome-polluted rice, green oysters, dioxin ducks, polluted groundwater, and many among others. Abominably, the government just ignored the reports from the people and just closed the case with a fine of NT$ 6,000-30,000 over those illegal businessmen. The leader of the criminal group Guo Zai-qin (郭再欽), former executive member of DPP, was prosecuted for his involvement not only in the case of Xuejia's slag but also in the notorious 88 shooting case of Nanxuejia, which dominated the election of the speaker and the interests of optoelectronics. Both cases have caused a deep and wide serious influence on Taiwan. How miserable ordinary people are. They have seen the corruption of self-serving politicians and the inaction of incompetent governments, both allowing or even instigating people to gang up to bully the weak, to create discords and antagonization among groups, and finally to generate injustice and hatred. Yet, people could do nothing about it.</p><p> </p><p>Let me reassure you: no animals could perform such cunning, shameless and ruthless acts as a human can do. The world-famous book <em>War Horse</em> is about the deep affection between pony Joey and his young master Albert. Playing and working together, they knew, trusted and loved each other. Unfortunately, during World War I, Joey was forced to fight the battles in France and Germany. Friendly, brave, and stable, Joey became one of the best loved and most respected war horses. </p><p><em>A Lion Called Christian</em> is another popular book about a touching story that happened between humans and a beast. Two young Australian guys bought a four-month-old lion from a supermarket in 1969 in Landon and named him Christian. They hoped to raise him until he was old enough to return to nature. The three of them lived in a furniture store where the two Australians earned their living. Christian was a wise and active lion. He always went to the litter box for pooping; he knew exactly what “can’t” means; his favorite tricks were chasing other animals,  ambushing himself in the middle of furniture, and jumping on people. A darling to all the employees and customers of the store, Christian also became the attraction in the community. One customer even didn’t mind buying a table with deep scratches on its top, for as he explained, the marks would remind him of the existence of a beautiful lion. </p><p>In eight months, Christian quickly grew from 13 to 70 kilograms. It was time for him to go back to nature. With the help of a conservation group and “the father of lion” George Adamson, Christian embarked on a journey to Kenya in August of 1970. First, Adamson introduced Christian to the big lion Chappy and a smaller female lion. Although Chappy didn’t accept Christian as a friend, they finally got together for the wilderness adventure. One year later, the two Australians that had raised Christian went to Africa to visit him. Waiting and calling his name for hours, they finally saw Christian show up on a hilltop about eight meters away, with three female lions around him. As soon as Christian recognized the two guys,  the 140-kilogram colossus rushed toward and jumped tenderly on them, licking and kissing their faces happily.</p><p>Love between people and horses, lions or other animals do exist. Animals can be loving and loyal, doing whatever they can to protect or rescue people or even their family and kids. We really  should respect, rather than abuse, them. In comparison, it’s probably mankind, not beasts, that is to be feared and despised.</p>
