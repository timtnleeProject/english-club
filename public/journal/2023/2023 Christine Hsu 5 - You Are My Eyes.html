<p><strong>Oct. 24, 2023</strong></p><p><strong><em>You Are My Eyes </em></strong></p><p>"If you are available on September 9th, we cordially invite you to attend the members' meeting of the Visually Impaired Runners Alliance." This invitation arrived from the leader of the guide runner group a week after I joined them. The meeting entailed voting for a new board of directors followed by a communal meal, and I eagerly anticipated contributing to both aspects.</p><p>On the designated day, I was tasked with assisting members in the voting process. Alongside three other volunteers, I briefed them on how to complete their ballots and explained the election procedures. Amidst a bustling gathering of approximately 90 members and 70 volunteers, ensuring smooth voting proved challenging. Despite the occasional chaos caused by members struggling to hear the candidate announcements, the vibrant atmosphere was invigorating. Initially unfamiliar faces at my table became acquaintances through numerous conversations, facilitating the smooth serving of meals.</p><p>Graciously, a vegetarian meal had been arranged for me, and some male members even shared wine. I meticulously served each dish to the members, describing its contents, and marveled at how effortlessly they seemed to perceive what lay before them.</p><p>An hour post-election, the newly elected board members were announced, followed by a heartwarming performance by the previous four chairmen. Hastily positioning my camera to capture the poignant moment, I found myself unexpectedly moved, struggling to steady my hands.</p><p>Despite accompanying them on numerous runs, I had never fully realized the extent to which they enriched my life. Their stirring rendition of "You are my eyes" left me teary-eyed, resonating deeply as they sang of experiencing the world through the eyes of others.</p><p>A visually impaired runner I had assisted on two occasions once remarked that even a horse, capable of traversing vast distances, relies on guidance. His analogy struck a chord, underscoring the importance of our role as guides. Reflecting on over two decades of volunteering, I found myself wishing for a longer life solely to continue serving them.</p>
