<p><strong>Feb. 28, 2023</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Music That Touches Me </em></strong></p><p>“ ‘Schindler's List’ in the largest European synagogue in Budapest. Csongor Korossy-Khayll (Violin) &amp; Xaver Varnus at the great Jemlich Organ of the synagogue, with the participation of Balazs Barnkopf (Theater Organ) and Balazs Elischer (Hammond Organ). Recorded live in 2017.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFGrooN6YDc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFGrooN6YDc</a> </p><p>I have never heard a violin cry like that before. Look at the faces among the audience: the music seems to bring them back to the time when they were suffering various forms of inhuman treatments in the concentration camps. Just imagine the day when couples were cuddling, children were playing, friends were chatting, and  farmers were working, and then suddenly, their bodies were shattered, devastated, and abandoned in the pits. Children were helplessly and desperately standing among the sea of the corpses. I wonder what kind of humanity had caused such a horribly cruel sight! Is this human nature? We will never forget these terrible holocausts, and we should never let this unbearable crime happen again, never ever again. The older people tell the story to the young. The young will let the younger know what happened in the past. We must learn our lesson from history. </p><p>The music is so sad that it gave me a miserable feeling. I seem to have witnessed those people in concentration camps struggle for existence despite their sickness, starvation, and hopelessness. They were living on the verge of death. The atmosphere throughout the music is that of fear, sadness, and desperation. For those who have survived the genocide, they may be haunted by recurring terrible nightmares and indelible painful memories for the rest of their lives. As to the victims of the massacre, I wonder if they will ever rest in peace.</p><p>We may speak different languages, but music is the language that we all understand. A good piece of music will really soothe your tired soul, comfort your weary heart, and moist your eyes that have been dried out with crying. “Schindler’s List” is so plaintive that it really touches the deepest of my heart. Every time I listen to this masterpiece, I have tears in my eyes. We must not allow our differences and disagreements to form into conflicts of opposites, tension of violence, or even mutual hatred. It is important to know that exactly because each person, each society, each race, or each nation is unique, our world becomes diverse, colorful, and thus, interesting. Let’s agree to disagree.</p>
