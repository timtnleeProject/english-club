<p><strong>Feb. 27, 2023</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Funny Halloween Experience</em></strong></p><p>In 1998, I was sent to the United States to work at GE company for six months. Before I went to America, I asked a GE guy to rent an apartment for me. When I moved into the apartment and was unpacking my luggage, I heard someone knock on my door. I wondered who that was since it was the first day I was in America and I had no friends and relatives there. When I opened the door, I saw four or five children wearing Halloween costumes, standing in front of me, and shouting, “Trick or treat!” Quickly realizing that it was Halloween, I was very embarrassed because I didn’t prepare anything and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t say, “Wait a moment. Let me go to the supermarket to buy some candy for you all.” At last, I had no choice but to give each of them one dollar. When they received the money, all of them looked terribly confused: they had expected to receive candy instead of money. It was so funny that I could not stop laughing. I was also curious about their parents’ reaction after they went home and told their parents what had happened. Anyway, I believed they were having a happy Halloween.</p>
