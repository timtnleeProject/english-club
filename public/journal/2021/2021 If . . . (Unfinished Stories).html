<p><strong><em>If . . . (Unfinished Stories)</em></strong></p><p><strong>ALLEN CHEN</strong></p><p>Tuner is one of my best friends. If I had never met him, I would not have developed an optimistic attitude toward my life.</p><p>I used to be an obedient person without strong opinions, especially on matters of decision making. Most of the time, some of the major decisions of my life were made by my parents or people around me. What I needed to do was to simply follow someone else’s footsteps, and everything would be arranged and settled. Like most of my peers, I finished the education in high school, college, and graduate school as expected and then enrolled into the military service. </p><p>Tuner was one of my classmates during the six-month newbie military training before we were both dispatched to Mazu. At that time, I just viewed him as a peer, not as a friend. Mazu is an archipelago mainly composed of five islands. Tuner and I served in different troops on two different islands. . . .</p><p><strong>ANN WANG</strong></p><p>If I had not met my husband, I might have a different lifestyle now. By the time I was 30, I had already been working for several years and kept a long time relationship with my boyfriend, who is now my husband. I was tired of my work, my relationship, and my life and was eager for a change. Fortunately, I had an interview and got the job offered in Canada. . . .</p><p><strong>HERMAN CHIU</strong></p><p>If Covid-19 hadn’t happened, I would be traveling in Europe now. After finishing our trip to Europe in 2019, our team began to plan the next trip. I thought the pandemic in Europe would end in 2021, but it looks like it is getting worse and worse. I am wondering why Europeans don’t wear face masks as we do. If their governments don’t rigidly enforce the emergency decree, things may get worse. </p><p><strong>JO LEI</strong></p><p>If I could go back in time, I would express my sincere thanks to the man that I was destined to meet but not destined to be together with.</p><p>Many decades ago, I met this man at a hiking group. He was so quiet that I didn’t pay much attention to him. After several gatherings with our mutual friends, we became acquainted. We never had a real date, but whenever I got off work, he would appear timely. He always showed up on my way home and then pushed his bicycle to walk alongside me. What a coincidence, I thought. After he knew how much I had admired bicyclists, he started to teach me how to ride a bike efficiently. He was so passionate about coaching me that he once sprained his ankle without ever revealing it. . . .</p><p><strong>LILY CHEN</strong></p><p>If I hadn’t chased after the bus on a Sunday morning last month, I would not have broken my wrist.</p><p>On a Wednesday I traveled as usual with my friends near the Taipei outskirts where we often got together to have a nice lunch in some fine restaurant. Before I left home, my husband asked me to go back home early because we needed to head for my father-in-law’s house to celebrate his birthday. With my husband’s duty call ringing in my ears, I felt the great time pressure, which reduced the fun I had with my friends. . . .</p><p><strong>MEI WANG</strong></p><p>If I hadn’t met my husband, I would not have traveled to so many countries. Less than a month after we got married, we moved to Jarkata, the capital of Indonesia, which was my first time visiting the country. To settle down, the first thing we had to do was to find a place to live in. The realtors showed us about 20 houses and apartments. One and a half months later, we finally found the house we liked. . . .</p><p><strong>SANDY CHANG</strong></p><p>If I were a billionaire, I would buy for my family a new house with plenty of rooms. There would be a living room, a dining room, a study, a storeroom, a guest room, a washroom, and a big kitchen especially designed for me to be able to cook easilier and more conveniently. The house would adopt a minimalistic style so that I would not have to decorate it too much. Since I am getting old, I will not be able to clean the house as hard as before. </p><p><strong>SUZANNA KANG</strong></p><p>If I were a rich person, I would buy a sports car because I enjoy their fancy designs and the fast-speed rides – it’s just so cool! . . .</p>
