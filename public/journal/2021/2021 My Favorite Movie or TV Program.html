<p><strong><em>My Favorite Movie or TV Program</em></strong></p><p><strong>CATHY HSU</strong></p><p>The TV series Emily in Paris is my favorite program lately, but I didn’t finish watching it because I spent most of my time watching Korean dramas, among which the one that really touched my heart and made me cry and laugh at the same time is Brilliant Legacy. . . .</p><p><strong>ERIC CHENG</strong></p><p>My favorite movie is To Sir, with Love. The film, produced in 1967 and starring Sidney Poitier and Christian Roberts, deals with the social and racial issues in a British school. Its theme song, “To Sir with Love,” sung by LuLu, had peaked at the top of Billboard Hot 100 and had become the best-selling single of 1967 in the U.S. The film was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures in 1967 by the Directors of Guild of America and won the 10th Annual Grammy Award for Best Original Score from a Motion Picture in 1968.</p><p><strong>JANE CHENG</strong></p><p> </p><p>My favorite movie genre is thrillers. Whenever I find life boring, I will try to watch a thriller. It always scares and excites me at the same time, making my heart beat rapidly. Among all the thrillers I’ve watched, Sleeping with the Enemy impresses me the most. It was a 1991 American film starring Julia Roberts, a famous star whose films are very popular. In the film, the main characters Laura and Martin seem to have a perfect marriage. . . .</p><p><strong>JEAN LAI</strong></p><p>Somewhere in Time is one of my favorite movies. If the hero Richard hadn’t met an old lady who pleaded him to go back to her, he would never have found that he had had such a great romance with the lady, Elise. Trying to figure out the mystery, Richard sought out his college professor, a doctor of science, to help him go back to the year when he met Elise--through time travel technology. If Richard hadn’t been patient enough to withstand the many failures of traveling back in time, he would never have succeeded in getting back to the year 1912. </p><p><strong>JENNY DU</strong></p><p>My favorite movie is Frozen, a Disney animation about two sisters. This movie is different from any other Disney films. When we think about classical and traditional fairy tales, there may appear a handsome prince and a beautiful princess. This movie, however, focuses on women’s power and capability: A woman can face and solve difficult problems by herself; she does not rely on a handsome Prince Charming to save her but will try first to deal with troubles on her own. Moreover, I think this movie will educate children to know that a woman is not just a little girl or a delicate princess that needs to be protected or saved but can be a queen with confidence, bravery, and power.</p><p><strong>LORETTA ZHAN</strong></p><p>My favorite movie genre is drama. Among the many good drama films I have watched lately, The Bucket List is the most impressive one. It is a 2007 American comedy starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman to play the two terminally ill patients who escape from the hospital and set off on a trip to do the things on their bucket list before they die.  The film made me think seriously about how we should face the imminent death. Isn’t it more important to mend the bad relationship with our family when there’s still time? Can we do whatever we want --  no matter how crazy it is -- as the characters in the film did, without regarding our family’s objections? </p>
