<p><strong>Aug. 1, 2021</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Memo of the Covid-19 Pandemic</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>There is a war happening between humans and viruses. In this article I’m trying to recall what has happened in the past two years. </p><p> </p><p>Our enemy, the COVID-19 virus, started to spread in the year 2020. Due to its quick spread, our healthcare system collapsed, causing millions of deaths. Luckily we had two shields against the virus: wearing masks and washing hands. These two behaviors eventually became parts of our daily basis, and social distancing remained the main approach to keep people from getting infected before vaccinations were finally developed in the late 2020. </p><p> </p><p>As a consequence, people’s lives have been greatly transformed. First, the government prohibits eating inside the restaurants. Second, most companies encourage their employees to work from home whenever possible, and students are urged to stay at home receiving distance learning. Third, the government imposes strict quarantine rules on international passengers, which makes traveling abroad difficult or almost impossible. </p><p> </p><p>Since people have to work or study at home, the boundary between work and life becomes blurry. Family problems emerge, increase or worsen when family members spend more time getting together in limited space. On the other hand, people are changing their daily habits. Many people start to rely more heavily on social apps to maintain their social needs, to learn to cook when eating out is not an option, or to  exercise regularly to keep healthy and boost their immunity. For me, the biggest impact is wearing a mask: though it’s an efficient way to block the spread of virus, it deprives me of not only fresh air but also “face to face” communication – a chance to see or show genuine facial expressions that go with the words. </p><p> </p><p>Despite the downsides, there are actually some good changes. First, the number of patients with flu symptoms has drastically dropped thanks to the improved hygiene habits. Second, the global carbon emission in 2020, according to a study, has been reduced by 6%, which is very close to the 7% as targeted for achieving the carbon neutral goal in 2050. The decreased human activities and traveling footprints are considered to have contributed to it, and ironically, our environment seems to have benefited from the pandemic war. </p><p> </p><p>Even after most people get vaccinated, the war continues as new variants of the virus keep evolving. The good news is the new variants become less deadly and humans will very likely be able to coexist with them in the future. The result of the war is yet to be determined. If you are reading this article 20 years from now, you will already know it. </p><p> </p>
