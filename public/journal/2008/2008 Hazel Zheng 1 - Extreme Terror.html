<p><strong>Mar. 13, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Extreme Terror</em></strong></p><p>I don’t remember the title of the movie, but I always try to forget its ending. It was such a terrible, cruel film that I wished I had never seen it. It is too difficult to get rid of the uncomforting feeling.</p><p>	</p><p>About 20 years ago, I saw a mini-series on TV. It described a traveler who was fond of outdoor activities. He especially loved to travel around the world on his own. One day, he went to the countryside of England. The twilight of sunset looked like golden splendor and was spilt on the ground. While he was immersed in this magnificent view, he found a house standing on a distant hilltop. It was bathed in the fog. He said to himself, “What a beautiful house it is!”</p><p>	</p><p>Curiosity ordered him to take a closer look. He went to the house step by step and then he stopped and called, “Is anybody there?”—No answer! He got inside and called again. A man came out and said, “How surprising! There has not been one visiting my house for a long time.”</p><p>	</p><p>At night the host asked the traveler to stay and had dinner with wine together. At the same time, they watched TV which showed horse-race gambling. The host bet a lot of money on it. They were all excited about the horse race and cheered up. By that time, the traveler had seemed to get drunk. Randomly he spoke out three lucky numbers. Although the host was not quite convinced, he still wrote down those numbers to bet. In the following evenings, whenever the traveler was drunk, he could always tell the host the right numbers to win. The host secretly thought unimaginable luck had befallen him, so he planned a trick in his mind. Four days later, in the morning, the traveler expressed his appreciation of the host’s hospitality and friendship, and told him it was time for him to leave.</p><p>	</p><p>Suddenly, the host said, “Yes. But before you go, maybe you would like to taste the best wine which has been stored for over 30 years.” The traveler was drunk again and got into a sound sleep. The next day when he woke up and sat up at once, crying, “I have to go now.” </p><p>The host said grimly, “I was afraid that you must stay here forever, because you are no longer able to walk.” Looking down, the traveler couldn’t believe his eyes—both of his calves were gone!</p><p>	</p><p>This is a terrible story. Even though I watched the movie two decades ago, its insidious plot still sticks in my memory. Whenever I think of the ending, I feel bad. I suppose the film wants to show an important idea that the gambling is the root of many evils. When the soul is controlled by evil, a human isn’t human any more.</p><p>	</p><p>Although the movie’s ending is incredible and cruel, I get a useful lesson, that is, to always be aware of and protect myself from danger. And so, my friends, always keep clear-minded and clear-headed, never expose your talent or possessions overly, and never forget that wine and gambling are always humans’ fatal weaknesses.</p>
