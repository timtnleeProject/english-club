<p><strong>Oct. 16, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>I Will Be 17 Years Old Tomorrow</em></strong></p><p>About 30 years ago, I wrote a sentence in my diary: “I will be 17 years old tomorrow.” At that time, I was just a high school student, with a wonderful dream for the future as well as hopeful expectation for everything. I believed that I would meet my Mr. Right at the right time. So, I felt everything was smiling and every morning the sun was shining. I did not know exactly what my expectation was. But I knew something extraordinary was to happen. </p><p>	</p><p>In fact, the sunshine came from a sunny boy whom I was not sure whether I liked or not. Because the college entrance examination was near, we pledged with each other that we should study hard until entering into the university. The sunny boy told me, after the examination he would put an ad in the newspaper, writing “Calling for No. 17; Calling for No. 17.” That is our secret code.</p><p>	</p><p>We were both 17.</p><p>	</p><p>Finally, we entered different universities and had a new life on different campuses. We had not seen each other ever since. Now, whenever I read the newspaper, I always remember the pledge taken in our young age.</p><p>Tonight, I will look at my son who will be 17 years old tomorrow. I try to search back into the memory of my being a 17-year-old, but it is too far away for me to remember any details except for the wonderful image of a young innocent pair. I feel sad that I have little communication with the young boy before me—my son—who will be 17 years old tomorrow. But, sad to tell, I did not share much inner feelings with my parents either during my teens.</p>
