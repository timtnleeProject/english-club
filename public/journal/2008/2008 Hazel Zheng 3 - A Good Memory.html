<p><strong>Sep. 26, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Good Memory</em></strong></p><p>I always ask myself: What kind of value do I hold in life? What do I consider most precious in the world? Should I leave something before getting old?</p><p>	</p><p>On a shiny day I was alone on the top of a hill, leaning against a tree and glancing up at the sky. Suddenly I understood: “A good memory! Yes, a good memory forever,” I muttered. </p><p>	</p><p>One after another scene arose from the quiet recollection of the past. It reminded me of my parents’ backs that were bent with years. I remembered when I was a little girl, my mother used to get up very early every morning, making breakfast and preparing lunch boxes, never failing to do so, not even once. </p><p>	</p><p>The picture of her routine work was imprinted in my mind throughout my life, and shaped my idea that being a mother means to obey rules and fulfill obligations. After my son, Nick, and my daughter, Tina, were born, I followed my mother’s footsteps to make breakfast and prepare lunch boxes for my family, day after day, and year after year.</p><p>	</p><p>I used to get up at six o’clock to prepare the meal, which though ordinary, was full of variety. For breakfast alone, choices included noodle, congee, fried rice, stead, pasta, rice roll, sesame seed bread, green onion pancake, dumplings, steamed buns, thick soup, mild and fruits. What was inside the lunch boxes also varied from day to day?</p><p>	</p><p>Sometimes, I felt tired and preferred to eat out for the sake of convenience rather than at home, but I thought of my mother’s example. As the proverb goes, “having your breakfast like a king for health is to be traded with both money and time.”</p><p>	</p><p>0One morning while Nick and Tina were having breakfast, they talked about their schoolmates who brought money with them to buy sandwiches, hotdogs, juice and cokes for breakfast. “I sometimes envy them for being able to do that,” Tina said. “I was once like you, but now I realize that Mom’s cooking is different, just different,” Nick said. How surprised I was to hear that dialogue. It suddenly took me out of the languor caused by my long-time persistence in the routine work.</p><p>	</p><p>Lingering in my mind is a gorgeous picture of the breakfast time, where my children were eating, satisfied, because blood is thicker than water. My heart was brimming over with an indescribable affection. A good memory enlivens our spirit and enriches our life.</p><p>Once when I was chatting with Tina, I asked her, “Someday when you become a mother, what kind of parent do you want to be?” She answered, “Like you—one hundred percent support for her children!”</p><p>What is eternal in life? Wealth and fortune? Honor and glory? Or a high social rank? None of those, I think. I know one day all things will vanish but what remains to be cherished is a good memory shared by my parents and my children.</p>
