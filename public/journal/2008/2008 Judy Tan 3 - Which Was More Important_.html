<p><strong>June 14, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Which Was More Important?</em></strong></p><p>Ling had been hurt by a fall in the parking lot in order to catch the high-speed rail. She should have gone to the emergency room immediately, but on the contrary, she went to the train station, with bleeding wounds all over her body, to refund her ticket. When she arrived, the ticket clerk was shocked by her appearance and wanted to call the ambulance for her. She stopped her and asked her to refund the ticket before its expiration.</p><p>	</p><p>Which was more important, money or life? I thought life was most important of all, but Ling seemed to prefer money to her life. Finally she went to see the doctor and found a fracture on her left arm. The doctor packed her hand with gypsum for two weeks. After two weeks passed, the doctor asked her to buy an artificial arm and put it on for two weeks. She complained about its high price before her doctor when she knew it cost almost NT$6,000. The more she thought about the medical expense, the sadder she was, so she cried a lot for it. Her sister told her, “You must have had hypochondria, or you would not have cried for such trivialities.”</p><p>	</p><p>One month passed, and her hand recovered. The doctor suggested she donate the artificial arm to another patient, she answered unexpectedly, “I’ll think about it.” How could she say that? She never suffered financial difficulties. Why did she have to be such a niggard? Why are so many rich people so niggard? Is money too important for us to treasure life and help people who are in need?</p>
