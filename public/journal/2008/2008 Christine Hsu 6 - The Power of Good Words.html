<p><strong>May 2, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Power of Good Words</em></strong></p><p>How does the power of good words stop a tragedy and improve a hopeless relationship between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law?</p><p>A Taiwanese lady met a Chinese man in Taiwan and moved to China soon after they got married. She did not get along well with her mother-in-law at the beginning and later, their relationship became worse. She even wanted to poison her mother-in-law. She felt so disturbed that she went to see a psychiatrist. After being told about her plan, the doctor, after a few seconds’ thought, said, “Well, I’ll give you a kind of poison powder that will take away your mother-in-law’s life slowly and then no one would suspect you of murder.” </p><p>“Now,” he continued, “a very important thing is that, every evening, when you serve her dinner with the poison powder, you have to say some good words to her, most important and last of all, you must ask her, ‘Do you need me to do anything else for you?’”</p><p>After a period of time, the mother-in-law gradually eliminated her prejudice against her daughter-in-law and started complimenting her. By and by, they shared more with each other and became close friends. The lady suddenly remembered that she had been poisoning her mother-in-law for quite a long time. She hurried to see that doctor again and asked him for a cure to save her mother-in-law. Surprisingly, the doctor said that he could not help and then laughed happily. The lady gave a confused and unbelieving look. The doctor smiled and said, “The powder I gave you is harmless, and so naturally I don’t have a cure for you.”</p><p>It was a real story told by a Tzu Chi Foundation volunteer who read it from a book written by an eminent monk. I felt amazed when I first heard this story and I felt happy for the two ladies who changed their attitude and thus enjoyed a better life. Good words are really powerful!</p>
