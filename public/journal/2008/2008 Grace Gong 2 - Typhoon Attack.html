<p><strong>Sep. 30, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Typhoon Attack</em></strong></p><p>It was an awful weekend. People had no place to go, but stayed at home and did nothing but eat junk food and watch TV.</p><p>	</p><p>The typhoon Jang Mi attacked Taiwan Saturday through Monday. It rained like water being poured down from up above the sky. The Ching Mei stream almost overflowed onto the road. I really hate weather like this, with air full of dampness and humidity. It makes me feel sweaty and uncomfortable. I also have to keep mopping the wet floor due to the heavy rain and strong wind constantly beating the window. I can’t go out to walk around the riverside as usual, nor can I go shopping since no shop is open. The whole city turns into a dull place paralyzed by the pouring rain and howling wind. Furthermore, I will have to pay triple for vegetables and fruits as most things that grow on the field are damaged. When a typhoon kisses the land, what most people stuck in the house will do is to keep eating. My husband and girls kept checking over the refrigerator, again and again. They could not stop finding food to fill up their stomachs, which to me were like funnels. They were never full, having meal after snack, and snacks after meal.</p><p>	</p><p>I don’t understand why a typhoon always comes on weekends these days to ruin people’s holidays. Maybe it’s the penalty from God on human beings for we have been wasting precious resources of energy on earth, since God would like people to cool down their activities outside and return home to live a conventional living style. At least, we must pay more attention to our family, to think more of the true value of life, and to respect nature, considering the increasing impact of Global Warming. The most important and immediate mission in front us is Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction.</p><p>	</p><p>According to the weather forecast, a new typhoon is coming this Friday and will affect Taiwan on the weekends. We had better watch out.</p>
