<p><strong>Mar. 7, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>A New Job</em></strong></p><p>It is really a big surprise⎯no, quite a shock⎯ that my boss promoted me as a deputy manager. I cannot understand why my boss would even consider me a possible candidate. The heavy pressures make me nervous. It’s true that some of my colleagues are dying for promotion, but never me. I really enjoyed my old position in the company. How am I to deal with this new position? I am a computer idiot, my English and Japanese are poor, and my social skills are lousy. I refused to take it when my manager talked to me the first time, but it seems useless to try to negotiate with my manager. He even asked me to recommend someone else for the position if I insisted on declining the offer. Why did he throw his problem back to me? I had no right to make any such suggestions. As it turned out, I had to accept it by all means.</p><p>People kept telling me, “Judy, you can do it. It’s no problem to you.” But it exists only in fairy tales for an ugly duck to turn into a swan. How can it happen in the cruel real world? “Judy, there are two choices for you: either you take it or you quit the job.” I know I must face the problem. I have to accept it.</p><p>I started to learn computer and job skills related to the new position from the former deputy manager. I might face a lot of difficult problems which she had confronted. There was so much more paperwork than before for me to handle. I quite often asked myself why I must do what I hated to do.</p><p>Two days passed by after I took up the new job and I still lived well. I found my new job was not so difficult to me and I had learned a lot more. Now I find it really a good chance for me to make self-improvement, though I don’t think I would ever like my new job. I have started to thank my boss for giving me this chance. I must work harder than usual and maybe someday I might enjoy it.</p>
