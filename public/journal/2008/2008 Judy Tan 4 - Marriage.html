<p><strong>Aug. 21, 2008 </strong></p><p><strong><em>Marriage</em></strong></p><p>Recently I’ve heard some TV reports on marriage. It seems that there are few people who want to get married because men worry they couldn’t afford a family and women are afraid to lose their freedom. It goes without saying that the marriage rate slides down year by year. Not only people try not to jump into marriage but also many who did jump out from it. The divorce rate here has increased up to No.2 among the world.</p><p>It is strange why a woman can only love one man in her whole life in the marriage, the same as the man. It is unhealthy for both man and woman couldn’t accept the other's love, so that causes a lot of problems in the marriage. It is very difficult to get along well with two people from a different family, different living style and different concepts. Marriage counselors tell us that persons who are either too independent or too dependent are not suitable for marriage. Too independent persons could not tolerate others and too dependent people lack strength to cope with the new pressure from the new family.</p><p>What is the meaning of marriage? To me, it means to find a person to quarrel with everyday. I really admire one of my colleagues Huey. Many years ago when she found how irresponsible a person her husband was, she kicked him out right away, though she must alone raise her two children, who were only elementary school students then.</p><p>There are so many men who are as lazy and dirty as pigs, as well as bad-tempered, so that women cannot stand them anymore. It is ridiculous that a lot of men are too idiotic to know why they are kicked out by their wives. My brother-in-law kept murmuring “I don’t know why I am divorced,” when his wife signed decisively on the divorce paper.</p><p>Will the marriage system continue in human society in the future? I just gave a silent smile when my friend asked me, “Judy, do you regret having married your husband?”</p>
