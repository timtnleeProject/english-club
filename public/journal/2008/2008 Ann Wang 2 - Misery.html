<p><strong>Sep. 8, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Misery</em></strong></p><p>	I happened to read a newspaper report that made me feel sorry for people’s ruthlessness. A woman called the fire station to ask for help because she had heard for days a strange sound coming from the sidewalk of her neighborhood. It sounded like a miserable cry of a poppy, which kept her awake late at night. Following the source of the sound, the firefighters tried to check the sewer but failed.</p><p>	</p><p>A few days later, one of the firefighters chanced to see the dog they had been looking for, a poppy sausage dog trying desperately to climb up from the sewer. It looked like a skeleton and was smelly. Stuck in the drains, it had been covered with the sewerage all over. The firefighter grabbed it from the intake in a hurry. Four times he cleaned it up to rid the terrible smell off its body, and fed it. The dog devoured the food with a wolfish appetite. </p><p>	</p><p>After turning the horrified dog into a lovely poppy, they tried to find a good home for it. Surprisingly, the poppy would not go near any man except the firefighter who had saved its life. They guessed that it must have been abandoned into the drains by its keeper for about one month. Its feelings were seriously hurt by human beings. Out of despair, it decided never to trust them ever again. I believed that such a hopeless feeling must have been repeated inevitably in its mind. Whenever the firefighter took it for a walk and passed by the intakes of the sidewalk, it never stepped on any intakes again but went around them mindfully. It must have had something to do with being stranded in the drains and getting no help for about one month.</p><p>	</p><p>I’m an animal lover. According to my interaction with dogs, their needs are few. They are easily content with feed and water. Besides, dogs are extremely loyal friends of human beings. Though mankind considers themselves the smartest and most powerful creatures of all, do they have the right to hinder the survival of animals with weaker competitiveness?</p>
