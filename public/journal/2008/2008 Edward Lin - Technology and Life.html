<p><strong>Oct. 3, 2008</strong></p><p><strong><em>Technology and Life</em></strong></p><p>What do you do when your mobile phone or NB is short of power at a critical moment, and it is inconvenient to charge the battery outside home? Now, a new technology is being developed to solve this problem.</p><p>Japan is researching on a Fuel Cell (燃料電池) by pouring the liquid methanol (甲醇) into a cellular phone or NB, whose subsequent chemical reaction produces electric power. As water is the only byproduct during the entire process, fuel cell can help preserve the environment.</p><p>This new technology still needs to undergo the testing period, and very soon mass production is possible. So, in the near future, when your cell phone or NB is running out of power, you can simply buy a 10 c.c. fuel cell at the 7-11 convenience store to restore the power. Isn’t it convenient?</p>
