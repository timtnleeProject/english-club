<p><strong>Mar. 2, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Visiting of My Mother</em></strong></p><p>My mother came up to visit me from Taichung in late autumn. Her visit is always a big issue to my own family and some of my close friends as well. She is a mother of two middle-aged women, but still enjoys taking care of me, my sister, and her grandchildren. To my girls, their grandmother’s coming means that we could have big meals during her stay, and they would say jokingly, “Whenever Grandma comes, you become a true idiot.” </p><p>	</p><p>During her stay in my place, every day she would get up early, try to move softly and quietly to avoid waking me up, and then walk to the market. She would plan what to cook and determine what to buy, taking full charge of cooking the meals. I would banish myself from my kitchen, where she brought her skill into full play with magical tricks. Every night at seven sharp, she would ring a dinner bell, and we would hurry to sit together to eat, each like a tiger that had been starving for months. </p><p>My mother is not only welcomed by my family but also popular among my relatives and friends. One time, she ordered from an egg wholesaler nearby sixty eggs all in double yolks to stew for my greedy friends who usually exchanged recipes with each other. When they got the brown shining stewed eggs, they so appreciated what my mother had done for them that they unashamedly complained that 10 eggs for each were not enough: The eggs were just incredibly delicious.</p><p>	</p><p>My mother received education only up to elementary school level. She never reads and doesn’t know much about Buddhist Scripture or the Bible. She just does what she thinks she should do with her sincere heart. My mother has served as a living model for me to practice the idea that love is dedication. She is always nice to people with her natural mercy. She shows her love by cooking amazing food for others. And I have certainly learned from her way of life. Christians in their prayers show their gratitude to thank not only god who grants them food, but also nice cooks who cook for them. And, in Buddha’s teaching, sharing wonderful food with others is essential to becoming a real Bodhisattva. She surely is one.</p><p>	</p><p>One day, I decided to take my mom for an outing. Preferring the wild nature to the lonely crowd, we decided to go to Wu Lai. But instead of the boring hot spring area, we went to the exciting Tong Ho Stream Preserved Forest. To get into the area required an application three days ahead for a permit allowed by the Forestry Bureau. I was not sure if I would catch a fish from the river, nor did I expect a spotted deer to appear in front of us. Therefore, like children ready for a picnic, we happily prepared orange juice, salad, rice dumplings, a handy dining table and a telescope before we set out for the wild mountains. What else did I need to bring? My sketch book. I expected to be inspired by the gorgeous scenery and share the joys of painting outdoors with my mother. She is a 75-year-old woman who likes art and has a very good sense of beauty. She likes to see me drawing and always asks many questions about paintings. I guess it is because my mother is fond of the peaceful feeling while looking at me painting.</p><p>	</p><p>I drove along the forest road. It was scary to drive on such a narrow path, especially when we encountered cars approaching us. I had no choice but to wait for those cars to pass by. Some nice people even got out of their cars to show me how to back the car. We were lucky just to make it. It took us more than two hours to “crawl” to our destination.</p><p>The view is spectacular: the murmuring stream and the flowing water. We could clearly see fish swimming in the river. Formosa Blue Magpies were singing on the trees. The scenes were just as beautiful as the pictures on the calendars. Most trees there were Chinese fir reserved by the Forestry Bureau. My mother hiked around to explore the wilderness. I then started a quick sketch of those glorious stones. But my clumsy pen could hardly express the grandeur imposed by the forests upon the splendid mountains.</p><p>	</p><p>We later entered a “forbidden area” which belonged to the Taiwan Power Company. TPC? We stared at each other and spurted a big laugh. The sign could not stop us at all. My father spent his whole life working in the TPC. He loved his job and performed it outstandingly. TPC had actually fed and nurtured me. We had lived in its dormitory until the year 2000. It is practically my home! We then got into the yard where peach trees were grown all over. That was really TPC style. TPC always planted fruits on its land, especially the peaches. Peach trees had filled the memory of my childhood. We also found two big, tall pomelo trees which were heavy-fruiting with hundreds of yellow-green pomelos. Under the trees, pomelos dropped all over the ground. Those still hanging on the trees seemed, arrogantly, to attract me to kiss them, knowing that they were too high for me to pluck them off. Then I thought of using a long fishing rod to shake them off, and it worked. Two beautiful pomelos with pretty leaves dropped down, and I caught them right in my hands.</p><p>	</p><p>We returned home one hour before dinner. My girls asked with very serious curiosity, “Where have you been?” I answered, “We came back from paradise. We have been to heaven.”</p>
