<p><strong>June 10, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Returning to the Past</em></strong></p><p>Last month, I went to Fu Jen Catholic University (FJU) by chance. For most people, it is only an ordinary campus. But, for me, it is not only the most beautiful stop along the provincial main road but also the milestone of my life.</p><p>	</p><p>I remembered when I was first admitted to FJU, my father and I took a train to Taipei to visit the campus, which was totally strange to us. I never forgot what my father told me when we entered the campus: “Why do the trees here seem to keep hitting our heads?” At that time I could not understand my father’s mood or his meaning. Not until I saw the grandeur coconut palms road in National Taiwan University, from which my father had graduated, did I suddenly realize my father’s great disappointment at FJU. In fact, after becoming a mother myself, I have understood even better the feeling of disillusion resulting from the gap between parents’ great expectation of children and the reality of what children can achieve. As parents, however, there is nothing we could do about it but only love and accept our children as what they are.</p><p>	</p><p>After all, my parents gave me a lot of blessings during the four years at FJU, where I began a new journey of my life. I never forgot that after my parents sent me to school at the start of the term, I found I was not quite prepared to fly alone. In fact, that was my first experience of living away from home. Free from my parents’ supervision, I became more independent.</p><p>	</p><p>There were so many beautiful memories at FJU. It deeply touched my emotions when I went around the campus and took a look at its every corner. I was so thankful for having such a memorable time at FJU.</p>
