<p><strong>June 25, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Wife</em></strong></p><p>My wife is a tender person. She always speaks softly and is easy to get along with. I feel no pressure when I am with her. I am impatient and fast-paced while she always speaks slowly and acts unhurriedly. When I drive the car at a very fast speed, she will remind me to be more careful and to drive more slowly.</p><p>	</p><p>She is a compassionate person and she works as a volunteer teacher at a junior high school on Fridays from 7 to 9 am. However, she is also a Little Miss Scatterbrain. Because of her forgetfulness, I need to keep reminding her all the time. I think weâ€™ve made an interesting complementary pair. </p><p>	</p><p>Reading is our common interest. Sometimes we will go to the library or a bookstore to read together. However, there are a lot of differences in our daily habits as we came from two different families. It has nothing to do with being right or wrong, good or bad. But I think being tolerant is very important. I will certainly do my best to cherish and cement the relationship between us.</p>
