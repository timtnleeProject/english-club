<p><strong>Mar. 12, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Making Dumplings</em></strong></p><p>My daughters love their mom’s homemade dumplings very much. My second daughter, Joy, especially likes the flavor of leek stuffing. She can eat about 15 of them at a time.</p><p>	</p><p>To make tasty dumplings, the first, and most important, step is to preserve the meat properly. The ground pork should be chopped thoroughly and then stirred with salt, soy sauce and water until the meat becomes sticky. You must preserve the meat in such a way for about 20 minutes before you fill it in the dumpling. If you don’t, the dumpling would not be as delicious no matter how much spicy flavor you add in.</p><p>Next, the dough must be soft. The northern Chinese mainlanders always say: “Stiff dough for noodles, soft dough for dumplings.” If you stick to these two very important basic principles, then you’ll have a juicy chewing no matter what flavor of filling your dumpling has. There are, however, some ingredients that can be added into the stuffing to make dumplings even more delicious: dry or fresh shrimps, bean flour noodles, tofu, spinach, string beans, fennel, perfumed sesame oil and a little sugar.</p><p>	</p><p>Although we can easily buy frozen dumplings from any supermarket or traditional market, it’s a lot more fun to roll out dumpling wrappers by myself, and I enjoy chatting with my family while making dumplings. Having meals at home not only is good for our health but also makes our family happy.</p>
