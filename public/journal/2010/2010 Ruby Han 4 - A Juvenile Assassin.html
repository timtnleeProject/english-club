<p><strong>Sep. 1, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Juvenile Assassin</em></strong></p><p>The case of juvenile assassin Liao Guo-hao has attracted island-wide attention recently. When he finally surrendered himself to the police, he attributed his degeneration to the failure of education, accusing his teachers of disliking his answers on the test papers. His public accusation shook Taiwan society. The minister of education felt sorry about this event and claimed to examine the current educational system. Many people, including some famous scholars, scolded the schools and teachers and said, “They shouldn’t have given up any student who went astray.”</p><p>	</p><p>In fact, with the bombarding information about Liao, We know his case is much more complicated than that. He was born in a problematic family. His parents were divorced at an early age, and his father was a drug addict who got in and out of jail very often. He was raised by his grandmother, who ran a small KTV shop involving sex businesses. </p><p>	</p><p>Because he was from a poor family and skipped classes very often, his junior high school advisor Mr. Liu paid special attention to him. Mr. Liu always talked to him outside class and even played basketball with him because Liao liked P.E. more than other classes. Mr. Liu had visited his home over 100 times in three years. In the last semester alone, Mr. Liu went to his home nearly 40 times. Liao’s school teachers never gave him up: they always loved him and encouraged him to turn over a new leaf; they kept telling him that it would never be too late to quit the gang and set foot on the right path. To show his gratitude to his teacher, he and another friend sent his teacher as a gift a wooden tablet on which a statement was written: “I shall never forget the kindness my teacher has done for me.”</p><p>Teachers all have a busy schedule usually. In addition to teaching classes, they must prepare for their teaching materials, read and correct assignments, and design and correct test papers, etc. What’s more, responsible teachers will always squeeze time out of their tight schedules to advise students, especially those who face troubles or seem to go astray. It is really hard to imagine how Mr. Liu could visit his student’s home over 100 times in three years. How could he do it? He must have had a great passion for his work and must have regarded Liao as his own son. His example is indeed rare in such a society as ours, which values only material gains. Although he failed to direct Liao to the right way, what he had done was honorable and admirable.</p><p>	</p><p>Just as one of Liao’s classmates has said, all of his misfortune was caused by his family, his gangster friends, and his decision to give up himself. Many of his classmates said, “He should take up the responsibility for what he has done. It is wrong to put all the blame on his school and his teachers.” </p><p>	</p><p>I think those education experts should have understood the case clearly before they made their criticisms. And I further hope they could make a home for school dropouts to help them other than just make cynic speeches or write critical articles. They need to get to know those young guys who have grown up in an unhealthy family and done poorly in their studies. If they do, I believe they will not easily jump to a hasty conclusion over a complicated issue.</p>
