<p><strong>June 4, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Being Married</em></strong></p><p>I have been married for one month. The wedding preparation took us a lot of time. We didn’t settle down until the wedding was held. I feel really good about the life of two people. For three reasons:</p><ol><li>Nobody will ask me “Why are you single?” because I am a bachelor no more.</li><li>I’ve moved out from my parents’ house. It is very good to have “a room of one’s own.”</li><li>Because my wife and I like to read, we will borrow some books from the library and read together in our spare time</li></ol><p>Of course, there are a lot of things to learn in our married life. Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the simple happiness I’ve never felt before.</p>
