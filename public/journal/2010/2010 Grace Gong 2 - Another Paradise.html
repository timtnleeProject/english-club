<p><strong>Nov. 27, 2010</strong></p><p><strong><em>Another Paradise</em></strong></p><p>When we talk about heaven, we think of the place where everybody wants to go but cannot until they die. Actually I know a place which can be a rival to the paradise promised by God, but you don’t have to die first to get there. Please don’t recommend the place I’m now introducing you to anyone except those who regard themselves as environmentalists, even though the place has drawn a wide public attention and become a popular scenic spot.</p><p>It is my second time to visit Jiu-peng (九朋) village, a place famous for the nation’s missile base under the Research and Development of the Chinese Academy Sciences. Joupeng used to be a mysterious and restricted area due to the performance of missile guided missions there, but in the last decade, it has been opened to the public and become a tourist attraction well known for its service of motor dragging on the sand, a modish exercise especially appealing to young guys. Unlike my husband, who is greatly curious about why and how often the military maneuvers were held there, I am fully infatuated by its natural, wild beauty.</p><p>Many factors contributed to my fascination with Jiu-peng. First of all, it has the exotic atmosphere of Bali. The second is the stunning scene of the countless Mikado Pheasants (帝雉) walking along the country paths and timberland. They seemed to walk arrogantly all over the place disregarding my marveling at their gorgeous colors, their slim and fit figures, and their elegant postures. They were fully concentrated on pecking at the plantago(車前草), which is their stable food granted from the wild. Another remarkable scene that deeply impressed me is the hundreds of buffalo grazing on the green grass. I still remember the fierce eyes of cows when they were defending their calf against my approaching, but my purpose of getting close to them was simply to take clear photos with my camera. The cow’s eyes filled with seriousness and curiosity had been deeply imprinted in my memory before my second time visit there. </p><p>Jiu-peng faces the Pacific Ocean with hills at its back. Rocky-mountains, meadows, sand, the sea and the wild animals compose the peculiar and unique style of Jiu-peng. As the constantly blowing Seasonal ocean-wind has a great impact on the village’s prosperity, trees are planted to serve as windshield for the farmhouses. Screw Pins (林投樹) and Coco Palms are grown all over; no crops or vegetables are seen. No convenient stores, no restaurants, no vendors, and not even one grocery store nearby. Of course, no hospitals, no clinics and no pharmacies. Living here, you had better reduce your materialistic desire to the minimum so that you can extravagantly enjoy the glory of Mother Nature. This small village has a population of only less than one hundred which consists mostly of elders and women. Kids are hardly seen there. The only one primary school has been discarded. Most young people are not willing to live a life of rural simplicity. Ironically, the playground of the school is full of buffaloes instead of children playing. It is said that the number of buffalo is even larger than that of the residents in Jiu-peng. Most residents live on husbandry, raising buffalos and pheasants, while a few others are fishermen. Young people leave for big cities where they dream of meeting their future spouses or gaining fame and fortune.  </p><p>Unlike modern cities, Jiu-peng keeps Chinese traditional customs. Men are always in a more favorable position than women. Men can pursue whatever professions or engagement that they find meaningful or interesting. Women, however, can only be housewives, or work as financial supporters of the family when necessary.  </p><p>	</p><p>For people like me who yearn for a country life after retirement, this is really a wonderful place to live in. This is a marvelous zone I have dreamed of for me to escape from all disturbances. This is another paradise that God grants us. In this wonderland, the electric grids are useless and mobile phones do not work at all. Jiu-peng is a perfect place where you can hide yourself and get peace and quietness. </p>
