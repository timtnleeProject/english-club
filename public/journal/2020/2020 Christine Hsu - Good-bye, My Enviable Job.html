<p><strong>Apr.  4, 2020</strong></p><p><strong><em>Good-bye, My Enviable Job</em></strong></p><p>Most of my friends were amazed that I could get an ideal job right after I was dismissed last year. I did enjoy both the location of the workplace--it only took me 15 minutes to get there from my home--and the benefit of free English online classes offered by the pharmaceutical company. However, I decided to leave the people there who made me lose my confidence totally.</p><p>This company was always filled with vivid activities, and my boss was a good person who always thought of helping cancer patients to complete their treatment, but my supervisor and the clients of the company were intolerable. Right from the first day at work, I realized it was not an easy job. It got worse after my clients started keeping an eye on my phone records. One of my major daily duties was calling patients and keeping record of what I had reminded them to do each time and how they responded. Our clients would check the record almost every day and email my supervisor for clarification if they found something wrong such as typos or unclear messages. It did not bother me until my supervisor asked me to make reports for typos, and whatâ€™s worse, she even prohibited me from getting off work before she approved my report.</p><p>Although I had paid full attention, I still could not avoid typos as the system disallowed any modification after the save button was clicked. Besides typos, my clients also criticized the way I kept records. I was so frustrated and did not know what to do to satisfy them. Gradually, I began to doubt if I was qualified for this position or capable of adjusting to the hectic working pace that does not suit an elderly.</p><p>I did like working with my colleagues and appreciated my boss who offered me this enviable job when I hit rock bottom, but I could hardly stand my supervisor who only focused on my mistakes and ignored all the efforts and contributions I had made. Two weeks after the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, I quit my job.</p><p>Being jobless for three weeks, I luckily worked again at the accountant department of the company that I had served 23 years ago. Despite my low salary, I am free from the burden of heavy workload and tight schedule, and the best part of it is that I am actually not the only one in the company who can get off work on time.</p>
