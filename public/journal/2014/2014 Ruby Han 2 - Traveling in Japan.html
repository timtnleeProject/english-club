<p><strong>Oct. 30, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>Traveling in Japan</em></strong></p><p>Feeling restless, I decided to take a five-day trip to three romantic cities in Japan—Kyoto, Kobe, and Osaka. Before departure, the weather bureau kept reporting that Typhoon No. 19 named WASP, the biggest ever on earth this year, would hit Osaka City and that all transportations will be suspended by 4:00 pm on Oct. 13. I began to imagine the possible danger we might face since we wouldn’t get there until noon. Unexpectedly, however, we saw sunrise around 6:00 am on our way to the airport. Maybe it was a good sign that we were about to have a safe journey. Some airliners canceled their flights to Osaka, including Taiwan’s Trans Asia, Australia’s Jet-Star, and Japan’s Peach Aviation, while our flight stuck to its schedule. We therefore got on the plane on time and began our adventure.   </p><p>Luckily, when we arrived at the Kansai airport, there was no wind but just a little rain. So our first-day journey ended with a display of umbrellas. At night we stayed in the hotel by the roaring ocean, and enjoyed a spa with its great facilities and a whole set of body care from hair to heels and toenails, which was really an eye-opener to me. In the morning of the second day, it was amazing to find the rainbow outside the window. We were truly grateful for God’s mercy.</p><p>In the following days, all sunny, we visited some famous temples. Some of them are the world cultural heritage sites—such as Todai Ji (東大寺) and Kiyomizu-dera (清水寺). Rokuonji (or the Golden Pavilion金閣寺), however, was one of the important reasons why I joined this tour group. When the graceful golden temple was mirrored on the still water, the moment of the sun setting really took my breath away.</p><p>We were so lucky to be able to visit the world renowned Miho Museum (美秀美術館), designed by Chinese-born American architect Ieoh Ming Pei (貝聿銘), commonly known as I.M. Pei, and completed in 1997. The idea of this museum was taken from the Chinese version of Shangri-La—“The Peach Colony” (or translated as “The Tale of Peach Blossom Spring”), written in 421 by the poet Tao Yuan-ming of the Jin Dynasty (265-420). They carved a tunnel out of a rocky mountaintop and equipped the soft pale green light with a triangle lampshade on both sides. After a five-minute long walk, a magnificent building in golden ratio with open space suddenly appeared in front of us. I couldn’t remember what art works had been displayed in the museum but the amazing modern architecture was totally worth all the trouble it took us to get there.</p><p>Another novel experience, though frightening, was feeding the Nara deer. About 3,000 deer could be seen not only in the park, but also around the street, asking for food from visitors. Two of them bumped my husband powerfully to fight for a pack of food in his hands. So if you are not strong enough, don’t even think about trying to feed them.</p><p>On the last day of our trip, we toured Osaka, one of the most ancient big cities in Japan, built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (豊臣秀吉, 1537-98), who was Japan’s first feudal lord to unite the country and thus ended the Sengoku period(戰國時代). The city was surrounded by a 120-mile city moat. Its well-known landmark is the majestic Tsutenkaku Tower, which was 64 meters tall when first built in 1912 and was rebuilt 14 years later into an eight-sided structure of 103 meters with an observation deck on its fifth floor at the height of 91 meters. In the afternoon, we were having a good time in the city’s principal tourist destinations such as Dotonbori (道顿崛)and Shinsaibashi (心齋橋), which together form into a decades-old gourmet and shopping paradise.</p><p>Because China, Japan and Taiwan are neighbors, they inevitably impact one another’s culture. Displayed in the TodaiJi temple were boards inscribed with phrases written in Chinese calligraphy such as “團結一致” (complete unity), “友情” (ties of friendship) and “互愛” (mutual love). At the backyard of the Golden Pavilion, erected was a Madam White Snake pagoda which, though much smaller in size, looked exactly like the Leifeng Pagoda (雷峰塔) near West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou, China. But speaking of food, Japan has a great impact on Taiwan. The Japanese style set meals, Okonomiyaki (大阪燒), and Takoyaki (章魚燒) are so popular in Taiwan that they can easily found not only from big restaurants of main streets but also snack stalls in little alleys.</p><p>Of course, the Japanese and the Taiwanese can be quite different in many ways. The former, for example, dumped used tissue into the toilet like many Westerners do while the latter discard it in a garbage can, which Japanese use exclusively for sanitary napkins.</p><p>One evening in the hotel, we found a formal notice printed in traditional Chinese posted on the bathroom wall. It said, “Please pull up the shower curtain. If you wet the blanket or carpet, we will lodge a claim for 30,000 Japanese yen.” We were struck by a feeling of shame for what our fellowmen must have done. Whenever we travel abroad, we must learn carefully about the culture and customs there and behave ourselves accordingly. Or else, we Taiwanese may become notorious around the world for our despicableness.</p><p>Japan is a clean, beautiful country and Japanese are polite and hardworking people. There are a lot of things we could learn from them. Maybe next year I’ll go there again. It’s so conveniently nearby and a five-day trip would hardly tire or bore me.</p>
