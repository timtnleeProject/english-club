<p><strong>May 25, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>Our English Club</em></strong></p><p>If I had not joined the English Club in Wuzha Library, I wouldn’t have met so many great friends and the terrific teacher, Jennifer.</p><p>Jo has been living in her big and beautiful home on the small hill for over ten years. She is good at gardening and almost every member of this club has received from her a beautiful flower pot as a gift. Sometimes she would complain that there is too much rain on the mountain, and that her house is too wet, so wet that she half-jokingly named it Cold Palace. Once I suggested that she move to Taipei City for the sake of warmer weather and convenient transportation. Unexpectedly, she said she would never consider it, not until her three big dogs all go to heaven, for she does not have the heart to leave them alone to die. How kind a lady she is! </p><p>Jean is a graceful lady with a smiling face and an amiable personality. She talks softly and tenderly, always showing great consideration for others. It seems that you could have a heart-to-heart talk with her any time. I like to see her in great composure, stand on the stage and make a clear presentation in fluent English. No wonder one of her beautiful daughters once served as an MC in an all-English college event. As the old saying goes, “Like mother, like daughter.”</p><p>If you talk about tennis, Ann could tell you a lot of world tournaments in detail. Lu Yan-xun from Taiwan, Andy Roddick from the States, and Justin Henin from Belgium all are her favorite players. Besides tennis, she likes swimming, singing, and learning English. She has been living a colorful life indeed.</p><p>With a soft voice and a slim body, Lily might mislead you to think that she is timid and weak. But actually, she is a brave and strong woman. She and her friends have taken trips to Europe and America by themselves. Admirably, they make all travel arrangements including accommodations, transportation, travel itinerary, and all sorts of details, all of which are just too difficult for me to try. Her recent plan is to learn how to play the flute and do sketches. She is really an energetic lady who never stops trying new things. Lily is the best example of the proverb “Never judge a book by its cover.”</p><p>When it comes to Christine, “superwoman” is the most fitting description of her. As the leader of the English Club, she is careful and responsible in arranging all details; she even made sure of her computer expertise to create a webpage for the club. Both mentally and physically strong, she overcame breast cancer, got a of lifeguard license, and bravely swam across the sea for about 4000 kilometers long near Wanmu Shan (萬幕山) of Wanli (萬里), New Taipei City. With a heart of gold, she has for a decade devoted herself to the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (慈濟) as an interpreter or voluntary worker. I really respect and admire her for her strong competence at work and great passion for life.</p><p>Jennifer is a smart teacher who is quick in answering our questions and knows how to lead us to speak up in English. She always brings up topics related to our reading or our life experience so that all of us can come up with some opinions to say, and by expressing them we improve our English speaking ability. She also encourages us to write in English, asks us to revise our journals again and again, and pushes us to give presentations in front of the class. If I hadn’t met my teacher Jennifer, I wouldn’t have written so many journals that recorded and reflected on my life in the past years. How wonderful she is.</p>
