<p><strong>April 20, 201</strong>4</p><p><strong><em>Anti-nuclear Demonstrations</em></strong></p><p>Have you ever joined any kind of demonstration in your city? Or at least you must have watched prTaichung and Kaohsiung. Protestors raging on streets in front of Legislative Yuan for particular purposes. On March 8, 2014, demonstrations were launched in some big cities, including Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung. Hundreds and thousands of people were walking on the street demanding the government to immediately re-examine nuclear safety and energy policy. The destruction of Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant by earthquake and tsunami has caused lots of serious disasters. The Natural Resources Defense Council points out that Taiwan nuclear power plants are all built on the volcanic belt at the highest risk of earthquake and tsunami. Consequently, one nuclear accident may bring about the destruction of Taiwan.</p><p>   </p><p>Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear accidents have given people a big lesson. History is not to be regretted, but to provide lessons for people to remember. Whether Taiwan should have the fourth nuclear power plant to develop its economy or not is still a controversial issue heatedly debated between the government and the green groups. Many civilians have been pleading with Taiwan's government to find alternative energy and renewable sources.</p><p>   </p><p>According to a CNN report, Munich, Germany’s third largest city, is trying to use the dung of zoo animals, instead of fossil fuels, to generate electricity. Zookeepers collect dung crops to be gathered in a room, mix in warm water and bacteria, and then leave them to ferment for 30 days until they naturally produce methane.</p><p>   </p><p>Taiwan is simply too small to afford a nuclear accident or to become another Fukushima. If Germany can use exclusively renewable energy, there is no reason why Taiwan can’t. Therefore, to protect their children’s future, many young moms loudly shouted slogans in the demonstration: “No nuclear power!” “Keep our homeland nuclear-free!”</p>
