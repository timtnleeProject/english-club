<p><strong>Dec. 15, 2014</strong></p><p><strong><em>Fighting against Cancer</em></strong></p><p>Since the end of last year, we have been undergoing serious hardships after being informed by chest physician Doctor Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital that on my husband’s chest a malignant tumor grew about 4.5 centimeters long. To decide if a surgery was necessary, the doctor examined my husband’s brain, bones and internal organs. Unfortunately, he found another tumor in my husband’s stomach, which later luckily proved to be a benign one. On the 10<sup>th</sup> of February, after a long operation, chest surgeon Doctor Chang showed us some pictures of the lesions (病灶) and told us that one and a half lungs and some lymph nodes (淋巴結) had been removed from my husband’s body.</p><p>But later during the recovery period, Doctor Chang told me that one of my husband’s lymphatics was infected and so the disease level increased to 3A. Accordingly, my husband was transferred to the oncology department to undergo chemotherapy. Although the seemingly endless treatment finally was over after three months, more check-ups were awaiting us. Our attending surgeon, Doctor Yang, said that there was no better way to stop the spread of tumor than using PET (positron emission tomography<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A3%E7%94%B5%E5%AD%90%E5%8F%91%E5%B0%84%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E6%96%AD%E5%B1%82%E6%89%AB%E6%8F%8F">正電子發射計算機斷層掃描</a>) for the entire body, CT (computed tomography電腦斷層攝影), and X-ray for parts of the body, and blood testing for the index of cancer. We felt so lucky and grateful to have health insurance cover the expense of high quality medicine and treatment.</p><p>The most terrible thing about lung cancer is its relapse in high frequency. Doctor Yang said, “Whatever you do, including eating well, exercising regularly, and relieving stress, nothing is going to help. The physique, and sometimes luck, decides everything.” Despite what he said, my husband tries hard to eat a lot of food with a component of antioxidants, anti-carcinogens, and anti-inflammatories, as well as to do enough exercises to sweat a lot or go up mountains soaking himself in fresh air. To keep up a good mood, my husband has been taking English and Taiwanese singing classes. In other words, he is making every effort to reduce relapse frequency. So, my husband really looks like a man in good health now.</p><p>The other day, unexpectedly, the doctor of the urological department claimed that my husband’s prostate gland cancer index became excessively high and needed to have another surgical biopsy. Alas! We are like a pair of little birds constantly startled by the sound of bow shooting. This war against cancer is full of struggles and hardships indeed. Apart from following the doctor’s advice to have regular check-ups, we’ll face the trial bravely and cherish what we own now with a strong conviction that we can still live a quality life. <br /></p><p><strong>Postscript</strong> (May of 2019): It’s been over five years since my husband got lung cancer in Oct. 2014. Everyone who met him was amazed by his healthier and younger look. Even his NTUH oncologist, after checking the reducing report of CEA(癌症指數), asked him what he had eaten. A couple of weeks ago, in the Public Health Center, my husband passed a series of physical fitness tests and got a 48 for physiological age, 52 for mental age. They were surprised that he got serious lung cancer five and a half years ago, so they invited him to share his experience with cancer patients someday. In fact, he didn’t eat any special expensive food or medicine. He has just had much antioxidative food like garlic, ginger, sweet potato leaves, onion, tomato, carrot, color pepper, bitter leaves (南非葉) from my flower pot, fish -- especially saury (秋刀魚) and mackerel (鯖魚) -- and many others. Apart from eating carefully, he does exercise till he is full of sweat every day. I think it’s the most important way to expel toxins and then get fit finally.</p>
