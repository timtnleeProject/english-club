<p><strong>Feb. 24, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>Anemia</em></strong></p><p>As a Mediterranean anemia patient, I am always aware that my hemoglobin never reaches the regular value of 12-16, but a health check last September indicating that it dropped to 7 scared me badly. And yet, who would have known that it actually turned out to help me win an ideal working schedule?</p><p>The result of the follow-up check-up explained why I often felt dizzy and panted severely, even when I climbed only a few stairs. Besides these symptoms of anemia, as the doctor told me, my cells were in constant lack of oxygen, which caused my heart to get bigger as it had to work hard to deliver oxygen to all organs. He seriously advised me to stand against the wall if I felt faint. He also mentioned that if I lost my consciousness and was delivered to the hospital, the doctor would have to save me by blood transfusion. Extremely terrified, I started a special diet besides taking prescribed medicine.</p><p>For the meals during the day, I had an apple, a kiwi, a boiled egg, a cup of milk with rich iron and various kinds of nuts. In the evenings, I ate red vegetables or whatever contains iron. During weekends, before breakfast, I would have Chinese medicine to increase energy. It took me a lot of time to prepare and finish all of them. Three months later, I had my blood checked again and the value remained the same! It then occurred to me that the heavy workload, not the diet, might be the major cause of my impaired health.</p><p> 	I began to think if I should work only part time. To confirm my idea, I started to take a sick leave once a week as a way to tell my boss and colleagues that I was really ill. Before it, I had never been on sick leave in four years. Besides taking sick leaves, I also declined some dinner gatherings with them. This really shocked them, for I had never refused any free feasts. After a few weeks, my boss seemed to have realized how serious my anemia was. When I discussed with her my ideal working time, she did not debate against me as she used to but agreed that in the following year I did not have to work on Fridays unless a very important event occurred.</p><p>It was more than exciting to have three days off after every four working days though the reason was most unfortunate. From this event, I realized that discussing problems with my boss was not as difficult as I had imagined and due to the special treatment, I sensed the value of my worth for the Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance I work for.</p><p>Anemia weakens and depresses me, but it also reminds me to be aware of my diet, emotion and life-style. Fortunately, I have gotten better as shown by the result of the third test last month. I believe if I keep a healthy diet and remember to take medicine as prescribed, I still could live healthily despite anemia.</p>
