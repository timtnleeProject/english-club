<p><strong>Dec. 27, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do You Have the Same Dream Like Mine?</em></strong></p><p>The dream was formed three years ago. My husband and I had a crazy idea. We dreamed that we took our three kids to travel and learn in an English-speaking country during summer vacation. A year later, the dream came true, which continued in the following year. I am really grateful for my husband’s unstinting support. Without him, none of these could have happened.</p><p>During our stay in Vancouver, we attended the language class in the local community center, the swimming class in the sports center, and other activities in the many summer camps for children there. After school, most of the time we cooked at home, had fun at the playground, and participated in special events just like local residents did.</p><p>In Perth, Australia, students have a different learning schedule from ours here in Taiwan. They study for two months in school before they take the two-week holiday. When we arrived there during their winter break, from July 1 to July 16, some organizations also offered winter camp courses for children. And yet, it was a cold winter. We could hardly adapt to the climate in the beginning, mostly because we came from a much hotter area. Eventually, we didn’t follow through the winter camp courses. Though we failed to take fewer classes than we had planned, we were able to enjoy the school library and the city facilities. We often lay lazily on the sofa in the school library to read a book or have a cup of coffee. In addition, many parks provided BBQ devices free for use. You only had to prepare food and utensils and then you could have a nice BBQ any time. Despite the convenience and fun, I felt that Perth was more tiring than Vancouver because we must plan on our own practically every day the exact details about where to go and what to do.</p><p>To fulfill our dream, we spent the two-month summer vacation abroad. That’s why I only work as a part-timer right now. My husband and I have discussed the rewards we got from these two trips. I love the experience of living in a different city, and I’m delighted by the fact that when we travel outbound, we are always capable of growing and changing for the better. However, I think two trips are quite enough for me. We now decide to replace the outbound travel plan with a theme trip for children to learn such skills as diving or skiing in the coming summer vacations. </p><p>After doing a lot for my children, I think it’s time for me to help my father realize his dream. I plan to visit Vancouver again next summer. It will be more convenient for my father to go around the city, no matter by bus or on foot. I hope it will be a great vacation for my father to enjoy.   </p>
