<p><strong>Dec. 28, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>The One-Year Experience of Being a Farmer</em></strong></p><p>As soon as I stepped into the familiar vegetable garden, a woman eagerly showed me her cucumbers on her scaffolding, and another enthusiastically gave me a bunch of green onions. These are the farmer pals I had worked with for one year.</p><p>Around one and a half years ago, a sign which said “Tao Hua Yuan” in Chinese and stood across from the Jing-wen Senior High School caught my eye when I took a leisurely walk nearby. According to the Chinese literary convention, <em>Tao-Hua-Yuan </em>suggests a countryside area where people live a simple and peaceful life--secluded, noncompetitive but self-sufficient. I was overjoyed to find that a modern Tao Hua Yuan was just a less-than-ten-minute-walk away from my place. </p><p>It turned out that Tao Hua Yuan was one of the projects for the greening environment movement led by the Taipei City Government. After I registered at the Shun-xing Sub-district Administrative Office and paid the rent, I became the owner of an allotment for growing vegetables. Immediately, I bought four bags of soil and prepared several tools for growing plants—a watering pot, a small round spade and a pair of scissors. It cost me over NT$1,500, including the 6-month rent payment.</p><p>After I watered the soil to make sure it’s soaked, one tenant friend who had just finished trimming and pruning her vegetables was kind enough to offer the cut-down broken branches to be mixed into the soft, loose and wet organic soil of mine. It did not take long before my allotment was covered with green plants. As the saying goes, “a good beginning is half done.” I was convinced that I would get a good harvest one day as I watched others’ allotments filled with sweet potato leaves, hong-feng dishes (紅鳳菜) and perilla (紫蘇).</p><p>Since then, I went to the vegetable garden to water my plants every other day. Seeing them grow taller and taller, I knew my dream of growing my own pesticide-free vegetables would soon come true. In order to fertilize the soil, a friend sprinkled some yellow rice husk over her allotment and kindly gave me some. It really helped the vegetables grow fast besides coloring our garden. Finally, there came the happy time of harvesting. To share my achievement, I sent my sister and my daughter some of my fresh vegetables. The vegetables I cultivated myself seemed especially tasty and healthy.</p><p>Encouraged by the initial success, I bought various kinds of seedlings from the Mu-zha market, such as mainland sister vegetable, shan-yao wormwood (山茼蒿), and celery. Those small, light green seedlings seemed to add considerable beauty to the vegetable garden. To my surprise, however, there was a big mess in my allotment the next day. Some seedlings were pulled out; some fell off the earth. One of the pals told me, “There were two wild cats here always jumping into the garden with new transplants to look for food.” With some branches, she helped me build a fence around my allotment to prevent cats from intruding. Thanks for her assistance, all of those seedlings grew well in the end. The shan-yao wormwood is the most interesting vegetable of its kind because it can keep growing after its leaves are plucked and collected. Besides, the doctors often recommend cancer patients to eat it due to its function of detoxification and liver protection. When it was in season, we ate it for almost every meal. </p><p><a id="_26in1rg"></a>Although the vegetable garden was not far away from my home, it remained a hard work for me to water the plants, loosen the soil, weed by hand, and grow and harvest vegetables day after day. Mosquitoes biting was another terrible thing, plus I had been insanely busy with other daily matters. Unfortunately, I could not help but to quit the cameo farmer role. As the ancients said, “each and every grain of rice in our bowls is the fruit of farmers’ struggle.” We definitely should pay the highest respect to farmers. All in all, I deeply cherish the one-year-long experience of zero-distance contact with the earth.</p>
