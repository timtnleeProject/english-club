<p><strong>Dec. 23, 2017</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Luxurious Flight</em></strong></p><p>I was quite upset when I learned that I had to, on behalf of my CEO, attend a 2-day global patient organization advisory board meeting on breast cancer in Germany and fly back to Taiwan on Saturday right after the meeting without staying there for the weekends. Despite my reluctance, I had no choice but to go because it seemed that I was the only candidate that was both qualified and available.</p><p>Though I was not given the chance for sightseeing during this trip, I was, however, allowed to take a business-class flight. Excitedly, I began to surf the Internet for information about what I could enjoy in the Boeing 777 airplane. The business class was spacious and elegantly decorated, and more importantly, I could use the Internet over 10,000 feet high and completely free during the entire trip. How incredible!</p><p>To be able to enjoy myself and fully explore the VIP lounge room, I arrived at the airport three hours before the departure time. Its environment was tranquil: people read or ate quietly. There was a great variety of vegetarian food, desserts, and beverages, and even my favorite wine. I had deliberately starved myself before I started enjoying the food in the lounge room at 8 p.m. When I was sitting on the luxurious sofa and enjoying one delicious dish after another, I congratulated myself for making the right decision.</p><p><a id="_30j0zll"></a>Upon entering the airplane cabin, I was intoxicated by what was before my eye. Am I really going to stay in this earthly heaven for the next 14 hours? I could not wait to use free Wi-Fi and share my excitement with my good friends via online message. And the thoughtfulness of the service astonished me, too. Once I got seated, a flight attendant showed up to help me hang up my jacket, to serve me a hot towel and a glass of juice, and then to show me how to use the facilities around me. Besides a light above my head--similar to the one I had used in the economics class, there was a table lamp and a small light behind my shoulder for me to control with a remote. Among all the facilities, the magic chair was interesting enough to arouse my curiosity. Instead of sitting up, I could lie down on it all the way to Germany. This, according to my earlier research, was probably what netizens most appreciate among all the benefits of taking the business-class flight.</p><p><a id="_1fob9te"></a></p><p><a id="_3znysh7"></a>Another benefit people most talk about is the sky lounge between the two cabins of business class, which offers a variety of cookies, fruits, beverages and wine. To enjoy the food and drinks to my heart’s content, I preferred to get them by myself rather than ask flight attendants for them. What’s more, on my way back to Taiwan, I asked them to serve me one after another glass of whisky, brandy and vodka with orange juice, one after another cup of tea and cappuccino, as well as a bowl of instant noodle. I stayed awake throughout the entire journey as if it were the last time for me to enjoy the luxuries in the business class.</p><p><a id="_2et92p0"></a>Not only was it my first experience of taking a business-class flight, but it was also the first time for me to attend such an unusual kind of meeting. Little did I know that there would be only seven participants from five organizations and that we would have to each share our own experience and answer questions about clinical trials with new cancer medicine. Some information and ideas exchanged in the meeting were too new for me to fully understand and I seemed unable to fully recount my experience and express my thoughts, but I did my best to communicate with some of the participants during the break time.</p><p><a id="_tyjcwt"></a>All in all, my earlier disappointment at not being allowed to stay in Germany for even one more day after the meeting was fully compensated: I have enjoyed a wonderful business-class fight, and more importantly, I have learned useful knowledge about clinical trials for me to share with my volunteer co-workers in Taiwan. I’m deeply convinced by one of Master Cheng Yen’s Jing Si Aphorisms: “The balls we get in life might not be all good, but an experienced and strong hitter can be ready at any time.” Three years ago, I represented the CEO of my organization to attend a Vietnam conference, the same way I did this time. In both cases, I had not begged for the golden opportunity but had always been ready for taking it. Thus, I completed my missions in confidence and with satisfaction.</p>
