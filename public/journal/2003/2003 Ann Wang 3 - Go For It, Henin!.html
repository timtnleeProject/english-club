<p><strong>Sep. 24, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Go For It, Henin!</em></strong></p><p>Henin is from Belgium. She is a versatile tennis player and a perfect athlete. She is obviously weaker in size with her height of five feet and six inches, but she has a strong will, which was extremely important while she was competing with Capriati, the host country player and a powerful foe, with good skill and in a strong shape, and the audience all cheered for her. Sometimes, Capriati fell into a rage. However, Henin still kept calm and steady all along to take up the challenge. The match proceeded for three hours. But, they came out even from start to finish. There came one after another Duce until they were playing off a tie. Suddenly, Henin played a line ball. At that time, she knelt on the ground and raised her hands. She was so excited that her tears came to her eyes. By now the audience gave her the loudest clap. She was so tired and almost dehydrated--it was obvious to tell. Then she was sent to the medical room for drip-feed, during which time she had to recover her physical strength quickly. After all, the final game which decided the championship was still waiting for her to finish.</p><p>The second day, Henin was controlling the whole match and showed consummate skill to beat Kim Clijstes in the final. In the end Justine Henin smiled. She had experienced the greatest hardship ever when she lost her mother at three and for some reasons, she had to take care of her little sister and brother. Breaking through such difficulties, she has developed her strong and unyielding will. Go for it, Henin!     </p>
