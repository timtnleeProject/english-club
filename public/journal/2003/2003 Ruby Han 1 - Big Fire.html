<p><strong>Sep. 23, 2003  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Big Fire</em></strong></p><p>A big building was on fire in Taipei County last week. Many people died or were seriously injured, which has made the problem of public safety more noticeable. In fact, a lot of potential dangers are hidden everywhere in Taiwan, especially inside tall buildings.</p><p>Taiwan's large population on a small island forces us to construct higher and higher buildings. Our governments, however, had never asked the construction companies to leave enough space for fire-escape, or to equip each house with standard extinguishers. Our government does not have scaling ladders that are tall enough and well-equipped fire-fighting trucks. Even worse, they couldn't stop the illegal parking of various vehicles which have obstructed the fire fight.'</p><p>So, if you want to live without worrying about fire in Taiwan, you'd better live below the third floor. God bless us all.</p>
