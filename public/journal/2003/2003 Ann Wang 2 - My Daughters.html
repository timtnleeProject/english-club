<p><strong>Apr. 30, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Daughters</em></strong></p><p>I have two daughters. The elder one is a college student, while the younger one is a high school student. The two sisters are very different. The elder sister is introverted, conservative and practical. She likes to read, to listen to classical music, and above all, to play the piano. Though she dislikes exercising, she plays tennis and goes jogging to keep up her energy sometimes. As a model student, she always studies hard and makes good use of her study. She, however, doesn't like to do housework. "Such a waste of time!" is her common excuse.</p><p>My younger daughter is athletic, sociable, composed and talkative. She is punctual, too. But sometimes she is so careless as to forget about her homework. So she always gets average grades. In her leisure time, she loves singing, exercising, especially playing volleyball, and playing the piano at times. It's thoughtful of her to take the initiative in helping with the housework.</p><p>My two daughters have very different personalities, but both of them are members of a chorus, and they are all good girls. I'm glad to have them. No. I should have said: I'm really proud of them.</p><p>Once again the U.S Open came to an end. Tennis is one of the most popular sports in the world, and the tennis tournament is a grand occasion in the year around the world.</p>
