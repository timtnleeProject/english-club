<p><strong>May 30, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>Our Customers</em></strong></p><p>Our customers come from all over the world. A great many of them are American and Japanese. There are also people coming from Korea, Russia, Germany, England, Holland, Yugoslavia, Indochina, Africa, India and even Mainland China.</p><p>In the olden days, Chinese people did not buy many souvenirs from our center. They were poorer then. But now, it's really different. We must depend on their consumption. Every dog has his day, I must say. They are simply rich now.</p><p>Many of our customers are managers, bosses, government officials or diplomats. We must deal with many different kinds of people every day. Our boss demands us to provide good service. Surely you can't keep your customers unless you offer the best service.</p>
