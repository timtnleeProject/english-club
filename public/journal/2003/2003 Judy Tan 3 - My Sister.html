<p><strong>May 9, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Sister</em></strong></p><p>Jane is my sister. I don't think she is clever. Sometimes she can be very stupid, I guess.</p><p>I asked Jane to apply for Genghis Nursing School in Taipei after she graduated from junior high school, even though we lived in Hsinchu.  The important reason was that one of my good friends studied in that school.</p><p> Jane has been a lucky girl all the time. She got a nurse's license and passed the national exam. That means she is now a government employee and keeps a steady job. After my little sister Yuchun died of heart disease, Jane went back to Hsinchu to accompany my old father. She fell in love with a doctor and married him. Jane's husband had been divorced once and has two daughters. Jane decides not to have any children. They own a clinic and have emigrated to New Zealand. Now Jane stays for two-third of a year in New Zealand.</p><p>Jane has a very kind heart. She does her best to help poor people. Recently the SARS seriously hurt many people, but she still wants to get into Hoping Hospital to help them. She thinks that everybody must die, and she's not afraid of it coming since she already has everything that she wants. If she dies on her job, she'll be proud of herself. Well, I'm also proud of her too.</p>
