<p><strong>Oct. 27, 2003  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Taiwan Will Be Better Because of You</em></strong></p><p>After my mom realized the pollution the use of the plastic bag causes to our environment, she has started using them as little as she can and always asked our family members to bring along some used plastic bags in our purse to put in anything bought from the market, or even from the vendors on streets.</p><p>Once we went to the market together to buy some fruits. While the boss took the bags hung on the wall, she stopped him and carefully took out the used plastic bags from her purse. After she put those fruits into her own plastic bag, she told me smilingly that we had saved several bags from being wasted.</p><p>After my mom gets home from shopping, she will always check whether the bag has got dirty or not. If it has, she will clean it with water and then dry it, fold it and put it into her purse again.</p><p>If everyone saves one or two or even more bags a day, how many plastic bags do you think can be saved in a year? My mom does her best to love Taiwan.</p><p>Several years ago, our family took a trip to Yi-Lan. In the evening, our car was stuck in a heavy traffic jam on our way home. Suddenly, a bag of trash was thrown out from the window of a car before us. My mom got so furious that she got out of our car and picked up the trash bag dumped on the highway. She then knocked at their car window and gave the bag of trash back to them. We were so surprised by my mom's sudden action. What if they attempted to beat her? My great and wise mom told us later that it would not have happened to her because there were too many cars and people around. No normal person would have enough courage to hit her, she said.</p><p>I think if everyone can be more public-minded, we will have a beautiful and clean country. Mom always asks us to turn off the light when we leave any room, to save our limited source of power. She also urged us to reuse the used paper to save our trees.</p><p>My mom devotes herself to protecting our environment as much as she can. I'm proud of her. I hope Taiwan will be better because of you.</p>
