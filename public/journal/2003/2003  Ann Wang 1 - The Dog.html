<p><strong>Apr. 23, 2003</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Dog</em></strong></p><p>I have been keeping Micky, a dog, since two years ago, which has brought my family a great deal of joy and laughter. Micky has brown and black hair and looks like a wolf. He's actually a wolf dog.</p><p>A week after he was born, my husband went to a pet store to see him every Sunday until he was two months old. Then, he was taken home by my husband. "What a cute puppy!" My daughters said with a surprised smile when first seeing him. He just urinated to leave a mark everywhere and then played balls with us for a while. Suddenly, he fell asleep on the rug under the piano and snored. He needed to sleep as much as a baby. It was his first day in his new home.</p><p>Micky eats puppy's food and milk everyday and sometimes beef. He is so naughty but cute. He loves us to throw him the tennis ball and he jumps at the ball quick-wittedly when we attempt to trick him. Although he didn't go to school, he has lots of skills. He can play many games and he always knows what we want him to do. Micky keeps watch every day and he never makes noises when we are home. And whenever he goes out, he always gets a lot of compliments from acquaintances and strangers alike for his good behavior. He is a smart and understanding dog. He is a son of mine. You give a little love to him and he gives back all his love to you. I wish him health and happiness forever!</p>
