<p><strong>Apr. 10, 2022</strong></p><p><strong><em>She Is Worth Waiting For    </em>   </strong></p><p>“I still remember how you taught us to fold the plastic grocery bags for reuse,” Principal Me-li Zheng told me repeatedly with a smiling face at a retired teachers’ union party.</p><p>I recalled that in one of the school meetings, out of a great concern over the excessive use of commercial plastics in our society, I proposed a motion for provisional order that all students and faculty members should avoid taking plastic grocery bags from the stores, and that once taken, these bags must later be folded for reuse to reduce the consumption of plastic. Right in the meeting, I demonstrated how to fold plastic bags as I had earlier learned from Teacher King Yu-yu (金毓瑜老師). </p><p>I was greatly touched that Principal Zheng still remembered the little episode after so many years. She has always been seriously engaged in environmental protection. Actually, Zheng and I share not only the same concern over environmental issues but also a similar interest in photography.</p><p>I enjoy taking pictures very much. From a dog jumping to catch a ball or a bird taking a bath with splashing water, to the moon climbing up the treetops or an airplane passing over the sea of flowers in the Taipei EXPo Park — anything can be the subject of my photo shoot. If I count the time accurately and get the right angle, I can always get a perfect picture. To my dismay, however, one thing used to bother me: No matter how hard I tried, I could never take a good picture of the crescent moon. I did ask some experts for advice but  failed to get satisfactory answers. </p><p>One day, unexpectedly, I received from Principal Zheng an online message of blessing with a picture of a slender curved crescent moon hanging high in the dark sky. I was very excited. Finally, it was time to have dinner with Zheng at the Yi-pin Zhuan (一品饌) restaurant inside the complex building of the National Normal University. I took the opportunity to consult her at once. “The key is to use high speed shutter and increase lens length step by step,” she revealed. Wow! How professional it is. Since there was no moon outside for her to take a shot, she showed me how to take beautiful photos of flowers instead: I needed to first point to the flowers on the lens with my finger and then press the shutter button. It turned out that the flowers in the picture appeared brighter and more colorful than usual. How amazing!</p><p>I really appreciate Zheng’s great care about the environment and her generous offer to teach me about shooting photos. And I was terribly sorry to hear the bad news about her sudden stroke. May God bless her to recover quickly so that I can learn more from her about taking photos. She is definitely worth waiting for! </p>
