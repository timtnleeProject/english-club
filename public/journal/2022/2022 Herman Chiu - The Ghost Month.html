<p><strong>Aug. 30, 2022</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Ghost Month</em></strong></p><p>The Chinese Ghost Month falls on the 7th lunar month, during which period the ghosts from hell are believed to be wandering on this earth. It is commonly considered a dangerous time to go swimming, get married, move to a new house, go traveling, or do many other things.</p><p>In my hometown, Taitung, the 15th day is the most exciting in the entire month. The authorities will block vehicles from entering some streets around the market, thus forming a pedestrian zone. A long line of tables will be placed in the middle of each street for people to place offerings on them to worship their ancestors. In this small town people usually don’t have much entertainment, so relatives and friends will take this chance to get together, walking around the streets to have an appreciative view of the offerings decorated with electrical lights, ice sculptures, and many other fancy stuff. Puppet shows will be performed on the outdoor makeshift stages to compete with each other, which children find most dazzling among all events. The ghost month is also the best time of the year to visit temples for religious rituals. </p><p>There are many taboos in the Ghost Month. The following are best known to the public :</p><ul><li><strong><em>Don’t go swimming</em>: </strong>Swimming is definitely prohibited in the Ghost Month. It is said that a drowned ghost may try to have someone drown in order to gain a reincarnation. In the countryside parents are busy with their daily work and don’t have time to take care of their children, so they will warn their children severely not to go swimming. If the children get caught swimming, they must be punished. </li><li><strong><em>Don’t dry clothes outdoors at night</em>: I</strong>t is thought that the devious spirits will wear your clothes and sneak into your house without being found.</li><li><strong><em>Don’t pat someone on the shoulder</em>:</strong> People believe that there are protective flames on each person’s two shoulders and head. If someone pats you on the shoulder, he may put out the flames and you may easily be possessed by evil spirits.</li><li><strong><em>Don’t pick up the money on the road</em>: </strong>People are warned that picking up the money on the road will bring bad luck.</li><li><strong><em>Don’t take a picture at night</em>:<em> </em></strong>If you take a picture at night, the spirit may show up in your picture.</li><li><strong><em>Don’t take the last bus home</em>: </strong>Usually the last bus departs at midnight, which is the exact time for spirits to haunt around. You may encounter them easily.</li></ul>
