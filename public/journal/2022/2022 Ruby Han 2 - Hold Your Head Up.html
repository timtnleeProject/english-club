<p><strong>Aug. 25, 2022</strong></p><p><strong><em>Hold Your Head Up     </em></strong></p><p><em>  </em></p><p>In order to reduce my backache, I took the advice given by one of my best friends: Whenever I washed dishes, I would sit on a chair to avoid bending over (彎腰) and  rest my elbows on both sides of the sink. Although it slightly improved the situation, I always felt terrible pain and needed to take a rest immediately after finishing the chore. I was so frustrated by such an endless burden.</p><p>Fortunately, one of my students sent me a book called <em>Steps to a Pain-Free Back</em>, written by Esther Gokhole. The author proposes a number of steps to take in order to remove back pain. Among them, the most important one is to always stand and sit up straight. Mrs. Gokhole thinks that all body aches originate from faulty or bad postures. If you stand and sit straight, the pressure of your shoulders, neck, back, wrist and even knees will be relieved and the problems of all kinds of pains will be solved at the same time.</p><p>Since then I have walked with my head up and my chest out for at least around 30 minutes every day. Believe it or not, now I don’t need to sit on the chair any more to wash dishes, and it is even easier for me to shampoo my short hair than before. It is really a big “achievement” for me.</p><p>In addition to relieving pain and keeping a good shape, holding my head up also helps me build a positive outlook on life. As I am walking straight on the road, I always notice the expansive blue sky and some clouds flying over the treetops, the tall buildings or the distant mountains. It seems that a bright future displays itself right in front of me.</p><p>So, don’t hunch over, my friends! Don’t keep looking at the ground! Holding your head up is simple and easy. Head up, shoulders back, chest out, and eyes looking straight, you will have a healthy and happy life. Give it a try, will you? </p>
