<p><strong>May 3, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>Firefly Watching</em></strong></p><p>Almost every summer, I would make a pilgrimage with my family to one of the three holy lands of fireflies to worship the mysteriously fascinating bugs: the Yun-hai Elementary School near the Bei-yi highway; Qu-chi in Wu-lai; and the Venice B&amp;B in Shuang-xi. Despite its adventurous excitement, the long drive on the winding roads is not only laborious but also risky. Fortunately, this year in the Muzha Park a firefly watching festival was held between mid-April and early May, which means I would be able to complete the annual pilgrimage 15 minutes away from home instead.</p><p>The first time I got to the park, it was already 9:30 in the evening and it was all hazy, so I didn’t see any fireflies. The second time I went there, I met my sister at 7:10. We saw thousands of fireflies dancing and sparkling over the dark field. As told, 7:00-8:00 is the time for fireflies to emit the brightest light of the day in order to find their mate. After they met their spouse, their lights would dim. So the later you arrive there, the less fireflies you could see. The third time, I got there with my daughter’s family at 8:10. It was too late for us to watch as many of them as we had last time. Worst of all, my grandson Enn wasn’t able to see them clearly because the crowd had blocked his view.</p><p>To solve this problem for Enn, I brought a folded stool for him the fourth time I went there. Around 7:30, we found a good spot for watching near the entrance stairways. Enn stood on the stool and said happily in a low voice, “Those fireflies are really like twinkling stars in the sky. How wonderful they are!” Sometimes when the fireflies flew toward us, we would stretch our arms to welcome them. One of them stopped on my hand for a few seconds and flew away.</p><p>I am really grateful to the Wenshan Community College, the organizer of the event, and many enthusiastic volunteers involved in it. Due to their hard work, I no longer need to make a trek before I enjoy the splendid sight of graceful fireflies.</p>
