<p><strong>Apr. 1, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Angels</em></strong></p><p>Without the help of 27 breast cancer patient volunteers working at the counseling hotline of Taiwan Breast Cancer Alliance (TBCA), I could not have accomplished the two challenging tasks—the filing of 500 patients’ counseling records and the 6-day workshop for training new patients. </p><p>Three years ago when I assumed the office of the supervisor of the counseling hotline team, there were only 12 volunteer workers with over 500 patients’ counseling records to be filed in the computer. In the past, volunteers used to simply write down the Q&amp;A in each call for counseling, but at the end of 2012, the TBCA decided to computerize all data. Since only two volunteers knew how to use the computer, it seemed to be Mission Impossible. I then decided to train senior volunteers to use the counseling system, and recruit at the same time 10 new volunteers to share the hotline workload. By the end of 2013, we were able to use our counseling system to locate patients’ records whenever patients called us. To reward their hard work, I had them attend basic and advanced volunteers training classes and help them each apply for a service-record book issued by the Taipei City Government’s department of social welfare. As a consequence, by the end of this year, they shall receive an honorary certificate from the city government for having serviced 300 hours over the past three years.</p><p>For a decade, we had been inviting medical doctors or professors to make educational speeches for patients but we found that most patients had difficulty understanding medical jargon. Last year, instead of inviting doctors, the TBCA chairwoman wanted our volunteers to give similar speeches. I knew immediately how difficult a task it would be for them to give formal lectures, even though they talked a lot every day on the phone with patients about their pathology report, chemotherapy side-effects and radiation treatment. And so I came up with a training plan: I assigned them different roles in accordance with their individual ability-- some of them were to be the speakers, while others assistants. We had six different classes held in six weeks. To service more patients, we held two workshops—one in spring and the other in summer. Totally we serviced 200 patients and recruited five more volunteers.  </p><p>Two years ago, most volunteers thought they could only answer patients’ questions by phone, but now they could stand in front of the public to give a pathology report and to share their treatment experiences. I feel really proud of and happy for their great progress. They are indeed my competent assistants and angelic partners.</p>
