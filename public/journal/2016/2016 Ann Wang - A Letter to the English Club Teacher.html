<p><strong>Dec. 9, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Letter to the English Club Teacher</em></strong></p><p>Dear Jennifer,</p><p>Do you still remember we had a wonderful field trip many years ago? We took a train from Chintong (青桐), to Houtong (猴狪), and then to Pingxi (平溪). Each member of the English Club was prepared to give an introduction to one of the scenic spots along the way. The small towns were quiet and peaceful. I really like the feeling of it. I clearly remember that I gave an introduction to Shifen (十分) — a quiet, beautiful town. Not long ago, I revisited there, trying to find back the feeling that had once touched me. However, everything has changed. The businesses and noises have replaced the quiet and the beautiful. The trains were crowded with people and litter could be found everywhere. I no longer found the peaceful town in the old memory. It makes me blue. Am I too sentimental a person? Could someone full of reason such as yourself understand my feelings? </p><p>Despite my sentimentalism, I wish you always have a good mood.</p><p>Devotedly,</p><p>Ann </p>
