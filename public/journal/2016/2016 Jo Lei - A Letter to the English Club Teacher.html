<p><strong>Dec. 23, 2016</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Letter to the English Club Teacher</em></strong></p><p>Dear Jennifer,</p><p>I had tons of words to say, but whenever I picked the pen, ready to write, my mind just went blank. I didn’t know how to write out my thoughts. Now, I’ve decided not to procrastinate writing this letter any longer. Or else, the letter would never be completed.</p><p>	</p><p>I would like to say Thank You with all my heart. You are the most marvelous teacher that I have ever met. You teach us how to appreciate a variety of genres of literature, how to pronounce accurately, and how to define grammar precisely. When some of us become very forgetful or absurdly confused about some questions, you always remind us of the answers painstakingly and patiently, never losing your temper.</p><p>It is so lucky of me to have the chance to study English after having graduated from school for so many decades. And what’s even luckier, I have a nice teacher.</p><p>May you have a pleasant winter vacation and a happy new year! See you next spring.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Jo</p>
