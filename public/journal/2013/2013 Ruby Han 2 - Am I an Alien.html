<p><strong>Mar. 2, 2013</strong></p><p><strong><em>Am I an Alien?</em></strong></p><p>Because of my friend’s recommendation, I went to the theater to see “The Life of Pi” on the first day of Chinese New Year. Unfortunately, when it was my turn, the tickets were all sold out and the clerk told us it would be safer if we bought the tickets online. And so we did it after we got home.</p><p>The next day, when we got there again with tickets, I saw someone taking her MRT card to the ticket seller and got a 50 percent discount, and got very upset. I suddenly realized that all senior citizens could enjoy half-priced movie tickets. I couldn’t help asking myself: Am I an alien?</p><p>The third day, in order to feel the festive atmosphere of New Year, we took a stroll around and inside the Jin-station Department Store (京站). About two hours later, we waited in a line with a sign of restroom on the side. After waiting for a long time, I jokingly suggested to my husband that we must try to spend more time in the restroom after such a long wait. One of the customers in the line heard our conversation and told us that they were waiting for the table in a Japanese ramen (拉麵) restaurant, not for going to the lavatory. My goodness! We really made a fool of ourselves. While we got home, we told our embarrassing story to my fashionable and experienced daughter. She informed us that the restaurant named Huo-shan-tou (火山頭) had been well-known for its ramen and she once had waited for over an hour for a table there.</p><p>     </p><p>About half a year ago, one day when I felt like having pearl milk tea, I went to the Wu-shih-lan (50嵐) just across from my apartment to buy a small cup. Minutes later, the seller gave me a large one with smaller pearls in it. I told her I wanted large pearls, not a big cup. Finally, she told me they had two kinds of pearl ball: The big one is named Bo-ba (波霸), and the small one, little pearl. Wisdom only comes with experience, indeed.</p><p>     </p><p>The other day, I ordered a Bo-ba milk tea loudly from the Ten-ren Ming-cha (天仁茗茶), but the seller told me they only had one kind of pearl balls. Oh, my. I’m such an alien.</p>
