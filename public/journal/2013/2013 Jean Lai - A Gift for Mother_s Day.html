<p><strong>June 26, 2013 </strong></p><p><strong><em>A Gift for Mother’s Day</em></strong></p><p>Since my daughters have grown up, they are always able to express their special love on special days, such as my birthday or Mother’s Day. However, my birthday is less than one month before Mother’s Day. I always ask them not to buy me another gift for Mother’s Day after they have given me one for my birthday. After all, sending gifts can be troublesome and costly.</p><p>On Mother’s Day in previous years, my daughters used to help with housework, make breakfast or desserts, or just treat me to dinner in order to reduce my burdens. But this year, to my surprise, they offered a whole meal with six dishes and a pot of soup. In addition, there was my favorite coffee cake for dessert.</p><p>On holidays, they could have gotten up late as usual. However, they got up very early on Mother’s Day. They went to the market, prepared the ingredients, cooked the dishes, and baked the cake. They truly completed a wonderful meal by themselves. While one was stirring the flour, butter and coffee powder, the other was arranging vegetables in the baking tray. Up till then, it had taken them a great deal of time. After the coffee paste and the vegetables were put in the oven, they turned to cut the chicken chest up into pieces, mix them with Chinese yam to be made into small balls, give each ball a press, and then put on some crumbs and pan them. Also, they made two kinds of dressing for the chicken balls. Besides the main dish, there were fries, meat, vegetables, and many others. Even though they seemed a little awkward and bustled in and out of the kitchen, they did not ask for my help but insisted that I should simply relax and enjoy.</p><p>Actually, they started to discuss the menu privately the previous night and surf the Internet secretly to find the proper cuisine and recipe. That was really a big matter for them since neither had done this before. I was greatly touched. Although they caused a little mess in the kitchen and the lunch was slightly delayed, I could deeply feel how much they wanted to show their love to me.</p>
