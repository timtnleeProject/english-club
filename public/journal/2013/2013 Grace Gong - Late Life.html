<p><strong>July 7, 2013	</strong></p><p><strong><em>Late Life</em></strong></p><p>I owe my existence to my parents, and yet not until my father got sick did I notice their aging, nor did I ever think of their future departure from this world. I was totally focused on my own family and personal business, which became a perfect excuse for me not to attend many important events of my biological family. I took it for granted that they would come to see me if they missed me. I naively believed that regimen could ensure longevity and physical strength, and that I could retain the father-and-daughter relationship for good—at least before I witnessed from the same body both the depressing infirmities of old age and the violent onset of severe disease.  I was too blind to see them as what they turned out to be, the eighty-year-olds. Gosh! They could fall on the street anytime with their bones crushed into pieces. It was shocking to learn that my father was diagnosed with osteoporosis and serious renal problem, only a notch above kidney dialysis. Besides, he had aggressive cancer cells in prostate.</p><p>What are we going to do? My mom kept crying all day long and felt helpless but she still did her best to support the whole family. My father was totally stuck in bed because of his broken bone. My sister Nancy was like a military general organizing various processes of treatment and giving directions to help father move forward to a better situation. I was more like a soldier following whatever order Nancy gave. I canceled a private trip and stopped all personal activities and then headed home to stay on my father’s side. I accompanied him in and out of hospital almost hundreds of times. During this period, I was a nurse, a caretaker, a teacher, a wife, a mom, and a psychiatrist sometimes. Every once in a while, I took care of his drip and medicines, cleaned his urinal pot, changed his clothes, helped him take showers, fed him food and cleaned his fake teeth.</p><p>After the first surgery was completed, he had been sweating at night, but had not bathed. I took off his clothes, put him on a wheelchair, and escorted him to the bathroom. I massaged his itchy scalp, blow-dried his hair and made it into small curls. In 15 minutes, my dad was transformed. He looked at a mirror with surprise. “Oh! I look like a whole new person. … I <em>feel</em> like a whole new person. I feel so comfortable,” he murmured repeatedly. “It is true that when you look better, you’ll feel better,” I tried to reassure him. My mom came in and heard us, giving out a tearful smile. As a routine, I reported his daily situation to doctors and fulfill every request demanded from them. All efforts were made to seek after father’s effective cure.</p><p>During the time staying at the hospital, my father and I had many heart to heart talks about life. He said he was grateful to his wife’s caring and satisfied with his daughters and sons-in-law. He praised the good conduct of his grandchildren and expected their better academic performance to come. It was surprising to hear these things which could never have been uttered from his mouth. He used to criticize almost everything from politics, economy, current trends and cultures to people, both young and old. Almost nothing could be exempt from my father’s harsh judgment. Of course he had always been fastidious about me, whom he had considered inadequate and useless. </p><p>Like most other elders, my father liked to recount his past life very much. Thank God he suffered neither Alzheimer’s nor dementia yet. Due to his high faculty of memory, I got to learn some amazing stories I would have missed without his telling.  He boasted of his accomplishments chronologically such as being the number one that topped all the 1957 graduates from the National Taipei Institute Electrical Engineering Department, being selected as “the Best Employee” of the Power Company—twice in his career, and winning the award for the Best Performance of Individual Department—again twice, with the engineer team led by him. Among all feats, his crowning glory was that he, largely self-taught, passed the very difficult Chinese Medical Doctor Examination before retiring from the Power Company in 1998.  </p><p>Knowledgeable but proud and demanding, my father had been a notorious perfectionist. Sometimes, I hated this character and even snickered at his meticulous way of doing things, his obsessions with details. However, he was so strictly self-disciplined that he successfully persisted in early rising, regular reading, weekly calligraphy practice, and finally the acquisition of a Chinese medical doctor license.  I had never inherited any shred of his talent or passion or character, but led a carefree but fruitless life instead, which is an exact antithesis of his. I am ashamed of myself and unworthy of my dear father.</p><p>I doubt if a man who always appeared or pretended to be strong would feel fearful of death. In my judgment, he was being wise rather than sad. Holding the perspective that life is uncertain, he made two lists for my family members — the “wish to do” and the “have to do,” and detailed his arrangements for my mom’s life after his death. </p><p>For the past ten months, I have been shuttling between Taipei and Taichung (where my parents’ home is), or Taipei and Kaohsiung (where my father receives his treatment). My father now lives a regular life with various illnesses. From the very beginning of this caretaking experience, I have never stopped thinking what the core value might be for a person who has almost completed the life journey from innocence to sophistication. As I figure, it must be a harmonious relationship with family, persistent self-improvement and preservation of personal integrity. This is indeed a precious lesson I am now receiving with great appreciation.</p>
