<p><strong>Mar. 29, 2013</strong></p><p><strong><em>What a Wonderful Return</em></strong></p><p>For some reason, I had stopped visiting Xin-dian Nursing Home one year ago. If I had refused the duty of Jan. 20 interview, I would never have known those seniors’ fondness of me.</p><p>On Jan. 20, in order to interview an American volunteer, I went back to the Nursing Home. When I stepped into the living room, I said hello to Grandma Lin without expecting any response. To my great surprise, she grabbed my hands tightly and said, “How long is it since you last came here? It must have been a year! You know, when you are here, everything seems to come alive.” Grandpa Jen, who was sitting in the corner, also greeted me zealously, “Did you go abroad? I haven’t seen you for almost one year.” All of a sudden, my heart was bursting with both warmth and sorrow. I wondered if they had actually calculated the days of my absence. Or else, how would they know that I had not visited them for 12 months? How cruel I was to leave them for so long without even saying good-bye. Right after finishing the interview, I ran away like a deserter to avoid their expecting eyes.</p><p>In the following month, Grandpa Jen and Grandma Lin’s words kept hovering in my brain. The reason which forced me to leave seemed to have disappeared suddenly.  Relieved of old grudges, I visited the Nursing Home again on March 17.</p><p>	</p><p>Upon arrival, I could not wait to tell Grandpa Jen that I would come on each third Sunday, but disappointingly, he was not seen sitting in the living room as usual. Rushing to his room and seeing him lying on the bed, I told him loudly after confirming that he was not sick, “You’d better dress yourself up and get ready to go before I finish this song.” While singing, I turned once or twice to check if everything was fine. Without his legs, Grandpa Jen moved a little bit slow, but he insisted on doing everything on his own. Finally, he changed a new diaper, put on his pants and sat in the wheelchair. We smiled at each other and together moved to the living room. After singing some songs with me, he looked outside and suggested we get some sunshine. Sitting on the opposite side was Grandma Lin, who followed the rhythm of songs sung by volunteer workers to clap her hands smilingly. I invited her to push Grandpa Jen’s wheelchair to the outside. She immediately stood up and pushed the wheelchair to the front door. On the way to the garden, my feet were accidently run over by the wheelchair. Grandpa Jen rapidly turned his back to ask Grandma Lin to be more careful and both of them kept reminding each other to be cautious. I deeply felt that their love for me was not any less than that from my grandparents. </p><p>While taking Grandpa Jen back for lunch, we kept singing on the way to his room.  He enjoyed it so much that he kept singing with me and did not mind his porridge’s being cooled off. Soon it was time for me to say good-bye despite my reluctance. Surprisingly, he responded, “See you tomorrow!” I shook my head and corrected him, “See you <em>next month</em>.” He only answered with a bright smile. Obviously, he became much better than he had been when I first saw him in the morning. </p><p>It was extremely hot when I stepped out of the Nursing Home, but the love and enthusiastic expectation I got from those seniors totally refreshed me like a cool spring. What a wonderful return!</p>
