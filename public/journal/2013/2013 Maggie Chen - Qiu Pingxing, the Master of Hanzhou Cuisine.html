<p><strong>May 25, 2013</strong></p><p><strong><em>Qiu Pingxing: Master of Hangzhou Cuisine</em></strong></p><p>Do you know which main course in Hangzhou cuisine is the most well-known? You might have tasted the Dongpo pork (東坡肉), but it is very unlikely for you to know who cooks it the best.</p><p>	</p><p>Mr. Qui Pingxing, former executive chef of Landis Taipei (亞都麗緻大飯店) was born at a poor village of Changhua, Taiwan. Sixty years ago, most people in Taiwan made a living by farming—Almost all children were expected to stay home and work in the fields. Qiu, however, though the eldest child in the family, left home for Taipei to establish an unconventional professional career and change his destiny. </p><p>	</p><p>It was definitely not easy for a 12-year-old boy to get a job in a metropolis. Initially, he was employed as a dishwasher at a restaurant. Two years later, he started to learn cooking from chefs. He then polished his skills working under some of Taiwan’s premier chefs. Where there is a will, there is a way.” At 40, he contracted with Landis Taipei to work as its executive chef. After a life-changing trip to Hong Kong, he made the Hangzhou cuisine their signature dishes.</p><p>	</p><p>In 1985, Mr. Stanley Yen (嚴長壽), the chairman of Landis Taipei, invited Qiu to work together to boost Taiwan’s industry of tourism affairs and cuisines. They headed several delegations abroad to promote Taiwan’s gourmet food worldwide. They also established a cooking school which offers students an unparalleled learning environment and provides hands-on classroom training and apprenticeships.</p><p>	</p><p>In this school, all students should attend an Apprentice Ceremony and a Graduation Ceremony. Apprentice Ceremony demands the students who are intent to become a disciple to vow to receive extremely strict training from teachers. The Graduation Ceremony, on the other hand, is planned by all graduates who are divided into two groups to prepare the big semester-end banquet taking care of all big and small details from submitting proposals, developing menus, to procuring food and designing invitation cards. The invited guests include not only graduates’ parents but also industry-renowned chefs and culinary experts who enjoy evaluating student learning outcomes. Since the official professional educational system was built up, more and more students have engaged themselves in this field. Taiwan’s restaurant industry has thus been upgraded and its new era has been launched ever since.</p><p>To help the underprivileged has always been one of Qiu’s many aspirations. He not only taught at the cooking school but also toured jails to instruct prisoners. “Teaching them culinary skills with which they can make a living once out of jail helps inmates reform and thus reduces crime rate,” Qiu said. In 2012, due to over exhaustion from work, Qiu died of cancer. Today, Taiwan’s gourmet has successfully won an international acknowledgement, and it is no denying that Qiu is one the greatest contributors.</p>
