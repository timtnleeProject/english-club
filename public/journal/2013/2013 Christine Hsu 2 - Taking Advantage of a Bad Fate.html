<p><strong>Apr. 19, 2013</strong></p><p><strong><em>Making the Best Use of a Bad Fate</em></strong></p><p>“How can I live without my legs?” Ultra marathon queen Chiu Su-zong cried to herself when she woke up from the Intensive Care Unit one month after taking an amputation surgery, but she did not complain much since she knew that such misfortune was caused by no one else but herself.</p><p>Back in 2008, Su-zong joined the 18-day Ultra Marathon Transe Gaule in France. Right after finishing it, she passed out and was delivered to the hospital. In fact, on the first day of the race she had found a small blister on her right foot, but she just applied ointment to it and insisted on finishing the race regardless of her husband’s caution. She paid for her stubbornness with the loss of her legs.</p><p>“The marathon of my life is about to begin,” said Su-zong to herself after flying back to Taiwan from France. A long rehabilitation journey was waiting for her. She continued, “In the past 50 years, I’ve never felt so helpless. I can’t even pick up things dropped on the floor. I tell myself that I have to recover, at least to be able to take care of myself.” With her typical ultra marathon spirit, she used all her energy to make herself live independently.</p><p>From lying in the bed, to getting up to rehabilitate and climbing up the stairs step by step sweating profusely, Su-zong endured extreme pain to achieve her goal—to live independently, and to be able to race again. After practicing for a long time, she finally made her dream come true: she was able to run a marathon again, this time on a bike. Watching her finish the 42-km long bike ride, I cheered her in my mind, “Su-zong, you have set one of the finest examples in the world.”</p><p>I learned about Su-zong’s story from a documentary “Forever Runner,” filmed by one of the volunteers at the Tzu Chi 3-in-1 team. Most runners began to run in their early age, but Su-zong’s first race happened in her mid-thirties when she joined a competition held by her employer China Steel. Since then, she kept running all kinds of races and got so many prizes and medals that they filled up a cabinet in her living room, and that she had never looked at them closely until she lost her leg. She said, “They are such a precious and unforgettable memory of mine. I know I could never go back to those moments of glory.” </p><p>Her words made my eyes wet. I, likewise, could not go back to the time when I still had two breasts. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer and lost my left breast. Like Su-zong, I did not complain much. When the doctor first checked my breasts, he said to me, “How come you didn’t see this tumor almost as big as a small hill on your breast?” My long-time ignorance of health conditions was the cause of my misfortune.</p><p>I have great sympathy for Su-zong not only because I like the way she faces vicissitudes in life, but also because I approve of the good things she did after she recovered from such big trauma. In 2010, she returned to France to share her experience with the contestants in Ultra Marathon Transe Gaule. Then she was riding her bike in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, with her brilliant smile, to encourage the runners to finish every race. What an optimistic and kind woman! It is such a delightful surprise to find that she and I both like to help people and make good use of our bad fate to better ourselves.</p>
