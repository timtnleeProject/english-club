<p><strong>Dec. 12, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>Making Good Use of Hotline 1999</em></strong></p><p>	The Chinese name of Hotline 1999 is 1999 市民當家熱線, which was launched by former Taipei City Mayor Ma Yingjiu on the third of July, 2008. It gives Taipei citizens an opportunity to communicate with the city government for solving a variety of problems.</p><p>	I have been working as a volunteer at the Wenshan branch of Taipei City Library for over a decade. Whenever I get there earlier on Monday mornings for voluntary work, I always walk around the little yard in front of the library building. One day, I noticed that the three wooden tables and benches in the yard became worn and even broken over the years because of constant exposure under the sun and rain. Besides their offending the eye, I was also much worried that some people might fall from the broken benches and got injured, so I called the line 1999 to report the potential danger. To my amazement, those ugly broken tables and benches all disappeared in the following week. Such efficiency! Now they are laying out the yard with tiled floor and plants. I believe soon there will be a beautiful view to be enjoyed.</p><p>	Although we all have a smartphone to tell the arrival time of buses, it’s not as convenient as electronic timetable at the bus stop. I had been eager to see one set up at the Muzha Market bus stop since it became so common at many other bus stops. Unexpectedly, an electronic timetable was one day set up on one side of the street near the market. Naturally I expected one to be set up soon on the other side of the street. But, it never happened.</p><p>	Finally, I lost my patience and called the hotline 1999. I told them two reasons why the electronic timetable needed to be set up: “First, there are 12 bus routes via the Muzha Market. Second, since one has been set up on one side of the street over six months ago, why not set the other?” Immediately, an employee at the hotline gave me an account and password to make a direct appeal to the government. A week later, they responded by saying that the setup of the electronic timetable had been scheduled to take place soon. </p><p>	About seven years ago, after I called the hotline 1999, the city government painted the crosswalks on the intersection of Baoyi Road and Alley 49 of Muzha Road, Section Three. I’m so grateful that the hotline helps us solve so many kinds of problems in our community. If you run into any difficult issue, you should also give it a try to make a good use of the hotline 1999. It’s reliable and helpful.</p>
