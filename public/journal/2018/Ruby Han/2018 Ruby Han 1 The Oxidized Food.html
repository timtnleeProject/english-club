<p><strong>June 5, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Oxidized Food</em></strong></p><p>	When talking about healthy food, many people think of organic food immediately. They worry that conventional food is polluted by chemical fertilizer and insecticide. As a matter of fact, the oxidized food has also become a serious problem.</p><p>	As experts explain it, anything can be oxidized in the air for a certain time. The colors of pictures or clothes are fading, food becomes sour, or peeled apple changes its color -- all are results of oxidation. The longer time and the larger part of an item is exposed in the air, the more it is oxidized. Therefore, we should develop a good habit of eating up peeled fruit or cooked food right away. It is bad to cut fruit into small pieces for eating later or even the next day. If the fruit is too big to be eaten up at once--such as watermelons, pineapples or papayas--we should cut down the part (maybe a half or a third of it) we are able to consume at one time and keep the rest intact in the fridge.</p><p>	Since my husband got lung cancer a few years ago, I have had no choice but to attend several lectures and read a lot of information about cancer. Many doctors and experts suggest that we take more antioxidant food like tomato, carrot, potato leaves, onion, spinach, seaweed, eggplant, color pepper, cabbage, nuts, ginger, garlic, green tea, blueberries, and many among others. Those vegetables are rich in lycopene (茄紅素), carotene (胡蘿蔔素), anthocyanin (花青素), catechin (兒茶素), all of which are substances that can prevent the damage of oxidation.</p><p>	In order to eat good and fresh food in every meal, I don’t think we should purchase too much food at one time in the market because it will lead to the problem of oxidation. Also, once the food in our fridge is overdue or starts changing color, we should throw them away without hesitation. After all, health is more important than anything else.</p><p>	Notes: We had better cook tomatoes with oil because the lycopene is oil soluble, and is seven times richer in cooked tomatoes than in the raw ones. Besides, I think it a good idea to put small cuts of tomato in whatever dish you are cooking.</p>
