<p><strong>Nov. 29, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>Memories of Childhood</em></strong></p><p>I was born in a small village, in the very south of Emerald Paradise, the East Rift Valley of Hualien County, near Fuli township. You couldn’t even find it on a map. There were only about 20 families living in this village in the mountainous region, and some of the families were our relatives. Most villagers were farmers who barely made a living in the limited riverside area due to the lack of irrigation canals.</p><p>Our house was a simple cottage, with a living room in the middle of the house. My uncle lived on one side and we lived on the other. A pig sty and a bullpen were near the house. There was no electric power and running water. My poor eldest sister, 10 years older than I, had to carry the water barrel with a shoulder-pole from a well about 300 meters away for at least three times a day. What was worse, it was an uphill road. I was too young to do that kind of labor. The house was a mud floor and the floor was not even. You could find small holes everywhere, via which small animals went in and out as they liked. I remember one night when we were going to sleep, I was told that there was a cobra in the kitchen -- banded kraits and cobras were very common snakes in the country. Frightened, I listened carefully to the sound of the zebra, which I thought might be chasing a mouse. All night I was so worried about the snake’s crawling into our bedroom that I could hardly sleep. One day when I passed the eaves of our house, I heard a strange sound in the living room. Noticing that the door was closed, I curiously kneeled down and peered through the hole under the threshold. There was a cobra inside. On seeing the snake, I ran to call my uncle. He together with his friend caught the snake, hung it on a tree, peeled off its skin, and cooked it.</p><p>All adults in the village were too busy at work to take care of us children, leaving us playing together outside home. Sometimes when we had to pasture cattle in the slack farming season, we would ride our own buffalos to the public graveyard – the only place where grassland could be found. There we played around and had the cattle graze nearby. On one occasion the cattle fought each other. They became so violent that most of us jumped aside. An older brave playmate, however, stepped out and made herculean efforts to separate the fighting cattle by pulling the rope fastened to its harness. I used to see this boy climb the cow from its head to ride it, never using the hind knee of the cow as we children usually did.</p><p> 	</p><p>Every family was as poor as a church mouse; therefore, I had never seen a child playing with a purchased toy. Some children then made their own toys, such as slingshots, rubber band guns, and so on. As for me, having accidentally found a stone shaped like a small car, I carried and played with it all the time. One day, after my playmates and I had played together in the woods facing our house, I fell asleep. When I woke up, all my playmates had gone elsewhere. It was so quiet. I felt as if all the villagers had disappeared and left me alone. Feeling bored and lonely, I heard a continual sound of a big gong from the road behind our house. I knew immediately that it was a funeral parade. The deafening roar frightened me, so much so that I dashed into our house and buried myself under the quilt until the sound went off. </p><p>On hot summer nights I would often take a long bench out to the grain-sunning ground and lay down on it to watch the starry sky. I waited and waited to see a shooting star. There was no light pollution, so I could see the Milky Way clearly. I was deeply fascinated by the night sky, which let my imagination run wild and free.</p><p>The elementary school I went to was about a 30 minutes' walk from home. There were many aboriginal pupils living at the foot of the Central Ranges. It would take them, without the company of an adult, at least one and a half hours to get to school. They had to cross a wide river through a very simple and crude wooden bridge without rails, about two meters high and 0.5 meter wide. Whenever walking on it, we felt like a tightrope walker, trying not to look down for fear that we might be made dizzy by the rapid currents and thus lose balance. It was heard that a child had once fallen down from the bridge.</p><p>When I became a third grader, our family moved to Taitung. On arriving at Taitung, the first thing I did was to ask my grandmother to take me to the seaside. I had known the sea from a book and heard it from adults, but never seen it with my own eyes. When I finally did, I even tasted the water to see whether it was salty or not as I had been told. Taitung was a town next to the mouth of the Beinan River. When winter came, the northeast monsoon brought a huge amount of sand from the riverbed into the town. That was why it was nicknamed “Sand Town.” If you saw the town from a distance, it was full of the sand dust and its sky was yellow. Almost all the pupils wore a pair of windproof glasses, similar to the ones worn by World War I pilots. </p><p>Living in Taitung was more interesting than in the small village. The Lantern Festival Parade is a big event each year for people in town. Unlike today’s Lantern Show in Taipei, all gods would take their palanquins to patrol on the town’s main streets. Before the evening, both old and young would wait at the roadside for the parade to come. The parade might last about more than two hours. I couldn’t help but wonder why there were so many gods in Taitung. We children liked to see the lion and dragon dancing, the stilt walking, and the parade of Seventh Lord and Eighth Lord — the lords who bring the souls of the dead to hell to receive judgment. There were some mediums marching in the parade, among whom attracting the greatest attention was the one standing on the front poles of the palanquin with two daggers poking through his cheeks. Such a gruesome and gory scene was simply too scary for some children to watch.</p><p>	</p><p>The most exciting and popular god for spectators was Lord Handan. There were some different legends about this god. One of the stories I learned from an elderly person was that he used to be a gangster that bullied townspeople all year round except Lantern Day, so it was his turn to be bullied on this particular day. When the parade was marching by, store owners, most of whom ran a porn business, would throw a firecracker at Lord Handan as a way to invite him. Then the so-called “Bombing Lord Handan show” would take place in front of the store. Many people would gather together and form a circle in front of the store waiting for the show to start, while the store owner would have the firecrackers ready. All participants in the show must follow the unspoken rules, one of which is never to throw firecrackers at the carriers of the sedan chair. Actually, sitting in the sedan wasn’t a wooden statue but one of the gang of rascals in the parade who took turns to play the role of Lord Handan. In order to show their courage and to consolidate their status in the gang, they took up the role bravely. “Lord Handan” was standing on the sedan chair with only a pair of shorts and a bunch of leaves in hand. The throwers ran after him and tossed the firecrackers at him. The “lord” fled in all directions in the circle. All he could do was to use the bunch of leaves to sweep away the firecrackers to protect himself. If he couldn’t bear with the sufferings any longer, another “god” must take his place immediately. The “battlefield” was full of the smoke of firecrackers that had been let off, and the strong smell of powder filled the air. The crowd’s mood was getting higher and higher. They shouted and shouted with excitement, whose noise was loud enough to wake the dead. The show would not end until either the store owner ran out of firecrackers or no more “lords” would climb the sedan chair to be the bombing victim. If it was the former, the god won and was rewarded with a very big red envelope from the store owner. But if it was the latter, the “god” lost and got nothing. Winning or losing, all “gods” would be lying on hospital beds the next day, moaning for some time. After all, they were only mortals playing gods.</p><p>Ghost Month was another highlight in Taitung. All families would forbid their children to go swimming. If the children violated the order, they would be grounded. The devout believe that during this time the ghosts from hell walk the earth and it is a dangerous time to go swimming, get married, or move to a new house. In the evening, people would place offerings of food on tables in front of their stores. There were many puppet shows to compete with one another. The streets were crowded with people to see the various offerings.</p><p>I  had a special experience with criminals when I was in the fourth grade. There was a rice mill across our house. The criminals who were chained together would come to the mill to bring the rice husks back to the jail at regular intervals. We rarely talked to each other, yet they made a deal with me: They would give me a dollar on condition that I collected cigarette butts for them. One dollar was big money for me then, so I tried my best to gather cigarette butts. Strangely enough, the police didn’t allow them to buy cigarettes but permitted me to give them cigarette butts. The jail was on my way to school. Sometimes I saw them working inside through the barbed wire. If they saw me, they would greet me, and I would greet them back with a shy smile. I wasn’t afraid of them at all. </p><p>In Taitung many people go to the seashore in the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival. We children would go in groups because it was creepy to go in the evening through the public graveyard between downtown and the beach. On the beach we would collect some driftwood to build a fire. Gazing at the moon and eating tasty moon cakes, we all had a pleasant festival to enjoy.</p><p>In my childhood days, most children suffered shortage of material resources, yet we always found some ways to make ourselves happy. Most of my classmates had never left Taitung before they grew up. I always envied the classmates who had been to Taipei and was curious about the outside world. When I first went to Taipei, I was afraid of being called a country bumpkin. Most children from the country had an inferiority complex in front of city people, but things changed when I was in the army. Some of my colleagues who were from Taipei in the army didn’t know that there were actually railroads in the east of the island. I told them that in Taitung there were barbed wire fences to block off the aborigines, and they believed it. One of them even thought that the children in Taitung rode a swine to go to school. City bumpkins!</p>
