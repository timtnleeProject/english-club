<p><strong>Oct. 5, 2018</strong></p><p><strong><em>No Regrets in Life</em></strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>I thought I could never do it, but I did: I jumped from nine meters high into the river. This event convinced me that I could do whatever I wanted if I tried really hard. When I was 23 years old, I led a tourist group to New Zealand, where bungee jumping is a very common activity. At that time, I didn’t have the nerve to do it, but I started dreaming about trying it one day. This summer vacation, my children attended the swim lessons at UBC University, and they played springboard diving in a pool 4.5 meters deep. As I watched my daughter jumping again and again with much fun, I almost wanted to try, but I was afraid that it might be too deep for me. I had experienced drowning when I was 18 years old. Even though I had already learnt how to swim, I always felt anxious about not being able to stand in the pool. I was disappointed at myself: as I grew older, I became timid about taking risks.</p><p>Just after this summer vacation, we joined a river tracing activity, which I thought was merely a walk along the river with infauna to be caught. That day, we woke up as early as five o’clock and drove to Lupixi River (鹿皮溪), Yilan (宜蘭). We gathered at Lupixi camp with the other four families, five teenagers and one coach. To prepare well, we put on wetsuits, life jackets, and non-slip shoes, and then did some warm-up exercise. Then, the coach explained about the process of river tracing. The most important point he mentioned is that if you fall into the river suddenly, you must try to get relaxed in order to be able to float on the surface of water. After we prayed for a safe trip, we started a three-kilometer round-trip. Along the way, we needed to climb rocks over the hill or to swim across the river by holding the rope. </p><p>In our return journey, in order for us to have a more complete river tracing experience, the important part of which was jumping river, our coach designed two routes for us to choose from: If we took the easy route, we would have to jump into a deep river; if we chose the difficult one, we would have to slide into rapid currents. Naturally, we all voted for the former. When we arrived at the river, the coach jumped first and made a safe landing. His nine-year-old son jumped afterwards, and my 11-year-old daughter followed. “Who wants to be the next?” My husband urged me to jump. My heart seemed to have stopped beating when I walked near the edge of the cliff. My husband spoke up again, this time in a harsher tone: “If you don’t jump, our two other children won’t jump either.” I no longer hesitated: Suddenly, I jumped. I didn't even know how I did it. Soon my son who was only six years old followed his father’s guidance very carefully and jumped by himself. I was so proud of him.</p><p>Finally, we all completed the river tracing activity and returned to the camp safely. Our coach requested us to make a circle and to share our feelings together. Most of us agreed that even though we found the activity really scary, we actually gained a sense of achievement and satisfaction from the risky moments, especially that of jumping into the river. What had seemed fatal to me turned out to be less hard than I imagined, and I reckoned that my children were even braver than I. Now I believe I can overcome anything. Nothing can ever stop me now.   </p>
