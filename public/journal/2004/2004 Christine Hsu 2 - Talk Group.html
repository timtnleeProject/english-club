<p><strong>June 11, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Talk Group</em></strong></p><p>It has been almost two years since we held the reunion (which I named Talk Group) on a regular basis. Four years ago, we didn't know each other until our kids entered the Wan Fang Elementary School. Most of us volunteered to work at school for our children's classes so that we got to know each other better and then became good friends. Two years ago, we felt miserable that as our kids were to be separated into different classes after grade 3, we would not be able to meet as often as we wished to. After an afternoon tea gathering at the Zoo Mall, we decided to have a regular reunion from then on. Last weekend was the 9th gathering and it was the first two-day reunion.  Not long after this semester, our kids will be in grade five. It's incredible that we could keep this group so long and no one wanted to quit.  During this reunion, we planned for our kids a graduation trip to be held two years later.</p><p>It was very hot to camp in Long-Men and my family didn't like camping at all and so I made a reservation for a log cabin instead of a tent. We shared this 6-person cabin with another family to reduce our accommodation expenses. This cabin not only provided us a comfortable resting place that night but also served as an air-conditioned playground for the kids on the second day when the adults were enjoying the chatting among themselves.</p><p>We usually had gatherings at each family's home and every time we would bring lots of food to share with each other. Though we held our gathering outside our homes this time, each family still prepared as many dishes as they could. Besides food, we had lots of things to chat about. No matter how early we met on the reunion day, we always talked until the moon came out. Even then, we were still reluctant to say good night. All of us felt excited by this gathering because we didn't need to go home no matter how dark the sky turned. After talking about kids, school and teachers, we began to share our romances. One couple met each other when they were only 10 years old and another couple knew each other in a game where girls found their matches by picking up a motorcycle key from a heap of keys. Some of those fathers recalled how hard they had polished their motorcycles so that their companions could sit closer to them. One of the families brought along their friends. After joining our talks, they were amazed by the wonderfully intimate friendship established among us. </p><p>To keep this special group of friends in closer contact with one another, I modified an old website which I had established for my elder daughter's class of grade 2. On it I also posted the pictures taken during our outings, as a way to help the participant families to preserve these splendid memories they shared together.</p>
