<p><strong>April 9, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>My Special Nurses</em></strong></p><p><strong>  </strong></p><p>Last Thursday night, I went to sleep instead of watching TV after dinner. I felt dizzy badly. My younger daughter, Julie, came to check my forehead with her warm hand and then took the thermometer to check my temperature. It was 37.5 degrees Celsius. She put an ice bag on my forehead. I had never taught her that. She just did what I had done for her when she got sick. Where was my elder daughter, Emily? She was busy preparing hot water for me. Making sure I was ok, they turned off the light and went out of my room. I really enjoyed their services at that moment. What adorable girls they are! They are my special nurses.</p><p>A similar scene came into my mind at that time. Two years ago after I got the chemotherapy, I would often feel very uncomfortable. My two daughters would act like nurses to look after me. Passing water or fruits or serving a massage, they tried everything to make me feel better.</p><p>Last time when I got sick, I asked Emily to cook some noodles with eggs for lunch because I was too weak to get up. She followed my order to cook the noodles. To my great surprise, the noodles were more delicious than I expected. After that, Emily was interested in cooking and took every chance to practice on it. I thought cooking was right up her alley. Once she asked my mother, "Grandmother, why do you cook so well, but my mother doesn't?"</p><p>I have never heard her say that again since I started to cook vegetarian dishes. Even my husband felt amazed by the delicious dishes I cooked recently. Afraid that they might dislike having only vegetables, I began to pay attention to every dish's color and design. I make careful observations of every dish's ingredients and visual appeal when I eat outside. I do believe the visual appeal of a dish is as important as its flavor.</p>
