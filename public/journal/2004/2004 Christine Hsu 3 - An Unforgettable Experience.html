<p><strong>Sep. 24, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>An Unforgettable Experience</em></strong></p><p>   </p><p>It was the first time I went to pick up a westerner who came to get the bone marrow of a matching donor from Tzu-Chi hospital in Hualien. I felt very excited and so did my kids, but we failed the mission.</p><p>In terminal 2, it was really inconvenient to pick up passengers. It was not like terminal 1 where we could just stand in front of the arrival exit. There was a huge travel information counter outside the arrival exit and we could only stand on the right or left side far from the exit. I might miss the lady if she walked directly to the opposite side. My kids and I kept our eyes wide open and raised the name board as high as we could.</p><p>Thirty minutes afterward, I saw a tall lady with a light yellow suit carrying a blue box. I thought she was the person I was waiting for, but she went straight to the travel information counter and it was too far away for me to call out to her. I went to the other side of the counter and asked the officer to pass my name board to that lady and asked her if she came from Holland. The officer told me that the lady was going to the airport hotel and just passed through Taiwan. At that time, I did think about chasing and asking the lady myself but I was afraid that I would miss the right person if I did it. And that lady did not seem to expect anyone so I decided to keep waiting. I found that was a big mistake after all the passengers came out. Recalling my memory, I couldn't find anyone more like a Dutch than that lady.  The service counter officer broadcasted her name but she didn't show up.  I didn't give up but went to the departure hall to try to check the passengers' list of this airplane, but the Royal Dutch Airlines didn't allow anyone to check it even though the airplane had landed. I had no choice but to go home with my starving daughters. All of us were upset that we didn't make it. To comfort them, I said, "If we had picked up the lady, we would have to send her to Taipei. Then we wouldn't be able to go home and get dinner. We are lucky, aren't we?" On the way home, we listened to the music and planned what to have for dinner.  I was glad that they were not influenced by the situation they confronted and could adjust their mood quickly. Master Chen-Yen once said: Our hearts should be like a mirror, which only reflects the changes in scenes, but does not undergo actual changes itself.</p><p>I was still thinking about the whole thing after coming back home but didn't know how to find that lady because I didn't even know which hotel she would stay at. That lady who was reported to be staying in the airport hotel was still hanging on my mind and I kept thinking that she must have been the person I was waiting for. The next morning I went on the Internet to check the airport hotel's phone number. I couldn't believe that her name was on the customers' list of the hotel. Actually, she didn't know I would go to pick her up. That was why she did not look around for anyone to meet her in the airport. I reconfirmed her schedule of going to Hualien and told her that I would go to Taipei Airport to pick her up and drive her to the International Airport on Tuesday afternoon.  Finally, I could lay down the heavy stone in my heart. My mission was to make sure that she would go to the hospital as scheduled and I did it, even though I had failed to pick her up in the airport.</p><p>I am thinking of telling the officer who works at the travel information counter that not everyone who stays in the airport hotel is a transit passenger, and if she could have spent one of her precious minutes helping me, the result would have been totally different. I should be more cautious next time and trust my instinct.</p>
