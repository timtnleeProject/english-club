<p><strong>Aug. 27, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>What Was the Matter?</em></strong></p><p>Suddenly, you disappeared below the skyline. Nobody knew what happened. Sometimes you would be missing for one day, two days, or even three days and then you just recovered yourself and returned to work quickly. But this time, you haven't shown up for one day, two days, three days and over a week... All the time, we were not able to communicate with you because you turned off your cell phone. All of your coworkers worried about you, although you had just worked several months with us.</p><p>According to past experience, you would only contact us when you felt like it. We could never know what exactly you had done during those days while you were away. Even your family didn't know what you had done or where you had gone to. Such behavior will wear out everyone's sympathy for you. After all, you are old enough to take up the responsibility for yourself.</p><p>I know you are a nice girl. We all like you. And I always treat you as a daughter of my own. We have had a good time together. I know you were born in a problematic family. You have had to learn to take care of yourself since you were little. I know your father has no sense of responsibility, and your mother, a poor woman, has no capability to protect her children. All you can do is to learn how to make a living on your own. She could suggest nothing to you when you are in trouble.</p><p>Once I heard about your parents from you. You said, "All of a sudden, they disappeared from home for no reason. It frightened you at first. One day, all of a sudden, the kind mother turned up in front of you. You were surprised. Their repeated disappearance and appearance made you keep shifting your mood almost like taking a sauna. But little by little, you were used to it."</p><p>I was so sad to hear that. The situation was as dramatic as that in a novel. I think I should treat you with more subtlety since you had such a bad experience when you were little. I hope you can seek a normal living and find a good man to build a happy family together. God bless you!</p>
