<p><strong>Sep. 30, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Eating</em></strong></p><p>                        </p><p>There is one English saying: "You are what you eat." It is terrible to think all we have eaten are junks, oil, and even poison. Then we may gradually become a kind of creature with a small head, a big belly and big hips, and look exactly like a sparrow. Surely it is time to control our desires of eating. It is true that to keep eating in a healthy way is really a difficult job. Most of the time we just devour food like a wolf and a tiger.</p><p>Yesterday after eating a full bowl of noodles at noon, I then swallowed a large whole piece of moon cake at 4 p.m. and later a rich dinner set. How terrible it was: I ate just like an elephant! My body is just like a balloon; the more I eat, the bigger it becomes. Last Sunday my family and I went to the zoo; first I ate a hot dog at 10 a.m., then a box of cool noodles and popcorn at 12 a.m., and at last a great deal of food in the Zoo Mall's Monking Tea Restaurant at 2 p.m. My belly was so big that I looked just like a frog! Eat, eat and eat more. We just can't stop eating till we are inundated in the food sea.</p><p>Do we really need to eat? Are we truly hungry? It is silly of us to eat just to satisfy our gluttony. Indeed, we cannot live without eating food, but do we need to eat so much? It is crazy to spend all our time and energy to earn what we eat. And it is really harmful to let the desire of eating delicious food fill our brains every minute.</p>
