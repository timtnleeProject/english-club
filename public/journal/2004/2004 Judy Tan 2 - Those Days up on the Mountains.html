<p><strong>Sep. 22, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Those Days up on the Mountains</em></strong></p><p>A recent typhoon caused terrible damage to the Jian Shih Village of Hsin-Chu County, and it obstructed the Si-Ma Ku-Si traffic. It was sad to hear that many people got hurt or died in this disaster.</p><p>Si-Ma Ku-Si is a name familiar to me. Every time it is mentioned, I always remember the event 20 years ago. I went there to attend a wedding party as a substitute teacher in the Hsiao-Luan elementary school. I remembered that the bride was only 14 years old. It was incredible to me that so young a girl had become a bride. I was 20 years old then but I had no idea at all about marriage. It left a deep impression on me.</p><p>Si-Ma Ku-Si is also called "black tribal settlement" because that was the last place to be provided with electric power. Now it is famous for a divine tree, so a lot of people go there.  I rarely recall that place because that part of memory always arouses in me a sense of sadness.</p><p>Shiao-Luan is located under the Si-Ma Ku-Si; it is famous for its hot spring in the stream. Taiya aborigines inhabit here. They used the bamboo to build their house; it was extremely beautiful. The tattoo on the faces of the elderly people was really special. My second grade students were so lovely and intelligent. Once I asked one of my students to study math and I said, "If you don't know how to calculate, how can you buy anything from the store?" He just replied, "Teacher Tan, can you catch the squirrel glider? Do you know how to follow the trail?" I was speechless.</p><p>I stayed and taught there for one year. After I left there, I always dreamed of walking on the mountain for a long time and my dear students came to surround me. I can't forget how my students were swimming in the stream with joy and how we enjoyed the winter morning under the sun by taking the class outdoors. Really, I miss them.</p>
