<p><strong>Oct. 8, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>My Feedback on "Was It a Dream?" from </em>Unusual Stories</strong></p><p>The man in the story "Was It a Dream?" was grieving over the tragic event that his lover went out on a raining day and died of catching cold and was buried underground. He could not accept it. He could not face his friends and the house they had lived in. He left for a while. Obviously, he did not overcome his grief. When he was back and tried to take up his life again, he still could not face the room they had lived and loved. He wept and walked to her grave and stayed there all night. As a result, he got a nightmarish vision, from which he thought that he saw the truth of how he had been deceived by his lover.</p><p>It is understandable that a man who loved his lover deeply and lost her suddenly would be seized by enormous toments and have some unusual behaviors. But the thoughts and actions of this man in the story were so weird. It was unhealthy and futile for a man to mourn like that. I wonder why he could not bear to look at the things they had shared together. If he truly loved her, supposedly, he would have loved to stay in the house full of their love memories and touch with all his heart the things which belonged to her, instead of going away from whatever related to her. It seemed to me that he would not accept the fact he no longer possessed her, that her beautiful body and her pretty face, which used to belong to him, had decayed. I also wonder why he wanted to stay in the cemetery during the night. Did he really miss her and want to speak to her? What did he try to find out?</p><p>According to him, he used to be "wrapped up in everything about her: and no longer cared whether it was day or night, winter or summer. It seemed that he was not normal and was a suspicious, nervous and inflexible person. He might have controlled his lover in an extreme way. He was angry about her going out in the rain without giving him any excuses or explanation. Because of her death, he had no way to know the true reason. Subconsciously, he might doubt her loyalty. The vision he had was the reflection of his mental status. He thought she was not to be trusted, and so was anxious to look for certain proof. But a large part of that must only be a dream.</p><p>In this way of thinking, he could never get any comfort for his injured mind. He would suffer from the new attack of jealousy and hate. The better way to overcome grief, in my opinion, is to accept the fact that he could never see her again, to imagine that she just had to go to a far-away but heavenly place for some special reasons. He could give her a blessing and hope for her peace and happiness, to always remember the good things which happened between them. If he carries with the memory of her, the love will never end. The most important thing is not to shun away from your friends who are helpful in giving you support and encouragement, and whose kind friendship will provide you energy to get through the miserable time.</p>
