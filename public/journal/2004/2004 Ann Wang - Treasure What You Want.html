<p><strong>Nov. 9, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>Treasure What You Want</em></strong></p><p>â€œA daughter of another celebrity has committed suicide," I heard from TV broadcast again. Most people were shocked by the news and wondered: what so serious a problem could it be that she had no ways to deal with it, and chose to destroy herself? It was difficult to imagine what it had been for. Many of those who committed suicide were born in a prosperous and warm family; they were all dearest treasure of their parents who must have offered whatever they wanted. "How could you go first and leave me alone? Why didn't you let me know what you needed or what troubles you had had?" Her mother said it in a voice filled with agitation. "If I could, I would take all your suffering even at the expense of my own life. Do you hear me, my little angel?" She called again and again, weeping in deep grief.</p><p>It saddened me to think that the celebrity's daughter should have been satisfied with what she had owned, which was definitely more than what ordinary people could want. It's imaginable that a celebrity's child may have gotten more pressure than others, but she on the other hand also has a better chance to have her potential developed. What has motivated people like her to jump from a high building or to hang themselves, which I think demands great courage? How could they do it since their life was given by their kind parents? How could they not be grateful to their parents, but slight the valuable life instead? How unfeeling they are! They never thought about their parents but only themselves.</p><p>Compared with the disabled and the poor who strive to make a living, they have shamed themselves with such a foolish act.</p>
