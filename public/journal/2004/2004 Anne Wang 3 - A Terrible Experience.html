<p><strong>Dec. 6, 2004</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Terrible Experience</em></strong></p><p>Not long ago, I suffered a stomach ache whenever I was hungry. At first I simply ignored the pain and thought it would just go away after several days. During the time I tried to have some soda-cookies to help relax my stomach while I felt uncomfortable. Days passed, but my stomach ache still had not improved. It had been annoying me for some weeks. All members of my family worried about me and asked me to see a doctor. I delayed it again and again since I had tons of workload lately. They were tired of seeing me pressing my stomach in great pain. One day, they intimidated me: "If you don't do something about it, you might get cancer, you know." The words frightened me. After all, I was afraid of ending my life in this world and going into an unknown world all alone. Thus, I hurried to a clinic.</p><p>The doctor gave me some medicine and arranged the check of a gastroscope. On the examination day, I waited for about an hour, quite relaxed, for my coworker had told me that it was not a big deal. At length it was my turn. A nurse first had me swallow a small plastic cup of liquid medicine. Then in the same cup she filled in half viscid medicine, and said, "Keep it in your mouth and lie on the bed until the doctor calls you." My elder daughter accompanied me by the bedside. She told some funny stories to relax me. They were so funny that I almost laughed out loud, which made it hard for me to keep the medicine in my mouth. Reluctantly, I just signed with my hands to stop her.</p><p>My tongue became puffy little by little. About half an hour later, an intern asked me to go into a ward with some big medical equipment. A nurse led me with a friendly smile and taught me how to pose, which was a lateral position on a bed, and to keep staring at a point, and how to breathe in with my nose and breathe out with my mouth. She wanted me to practice for a while, and a few minutes later she asked, "Are you ready?" Seeing me nod my head, she gave me a short plastic tube to bite. An intern started to squeeze a long tube with the same size of a forefinger through my throat, while a second intern stood by the other side of me. The nurse told me, "Don't be nervous! Let the saliva well out!" while she kept slapping slightly on my shoulder to comfort me.</p><p>One minute later, "Do swallow!" the nurse said loudly. I didn't know how to swallow it since my throat was stuck with a thick tube. Once again she said, "Swallow now!" I still didn't know how to do it. And I couldn't open my mouth to tell her my problem. "My God! What can I do? What can I do? I wanna quit!" But, I couldn't express my thoughts; I was at the mercy of them.</p><p>After two minutes, the nurse left me alone and went out of the ward as I was finally able to swallow smoothly and all was getting steady gradually. A tube started to move in my stomach by the intern. Looking at the screen, he moved the tube continually, took some photographs with it, and said with a solemn look, "A duodenal ulcer is serious." As my eyes watched a directed point to steady myself, I felt like throwing up with the long tube being shifted into and out of my stomach by the intern. Suddenly I felt I had no air to breathe so I attempted to motion to the intern with my hand, but they seemed to have no idea about what I meant, and offered no help. The interns didn't notice I hardly breathed at the moment. They just looked at the screen and were busy with the photograph. One of the interns grabbed my hand and said, "You will get gastric hemorrhage if I don't check carefully. Now we can't see clearly because there is too much saliva in your stomach. Be patient. This will be finished in minutes."</p><p>To me it seemed like ages had passed! I began to lose patience as I heard "in minutes," for I could hardly breathe and was near suffocation. Already, I was at the point of death. I attempted to jerk the tube but my hand was grabbed by one of them. "Maybe I will die here. It was my fate." The idea flashed in my head. Adjusting my pose with breath exertion, I recovered my breath. In the meantime, the doctor was called into the ward by the interns and they examined the pictures together. And then the tube was jerked by them along with much saliva. I dried my mouth and said nothing, swallowing a pool of complaints.  </p>
