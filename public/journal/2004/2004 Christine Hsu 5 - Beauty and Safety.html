<p><strong>Dec. 3, 2004  </strong></p><p><strong><em>Beauty and Safety</em></strong></p><p>Last week I shopped around a few opticians to purchase a pair of new glasses. The last time I had bought it was 13 years ago so I was totally ignorant of current prices. It gave me a big fright when the clerk showed me the price list of the lenses my husband inquired about.</p><p>During the past two years, my eye-doctor of National Taiwan University Hospital kept dissuading me from wearing contact lenses, but I didn't take it seriously until last week when I went to see my daughter's eye-doctor. After checking my eyes, he found there were a few tiny scars on the edge of my eyes. As the doctor told me, these scars were caused by congenital cataract, which would make it easy for me to get cataracts earlier than people of my age. This news did scare me a lot though the doctor tried hard to comfort me by telling me that it would only take 20 minutes to remove the cataract.</p><p>I began to wear contact lenses when I was 20 years old. It felt so wonderful to get rid of my ugly and heavy glasses back then. But now I was in a dilemma. One can't eat one's cake and have it too. How could I keep the advantages of wearing contact lenses without damaging my eyes? I didn't want to be seized by any diseases and then get stuck in the hospital anymore. Between beauty and safety, I chose the latter.</p><p>These days I tried to wear glasses instead of contact lenses except for special occasions. Surprisingly, it was not as bad as I thought. I could move my eyeballs freely, and I could do exercises whenever my eyes got tired. After shopping with some opticians, I finally met a thoughtful and helpful clerk. Though the problem of her eye condition is not as severe as mine, she could understand exactly what I need.  I am looking forward to wearing the glasses she recommended. It would give me a new appearance and I hope it is a correct choice that will bring me positive change.</p>
