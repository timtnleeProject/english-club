<p><strong>June 20, 2019</strong></p><p><strong><em>Full of Joy </em></strong></p><p><strong><em> 	</em></strong></p><p>Behind the city government’s Wenshan administrative affairs building at Muzha, there are two tall old trees, whose trunks are around 25-centimeter- diameter wide, surrounded by a wooden platform for people to rest on. Strangely, one tree is luxuriant with thick leaves while the other has only dry branches hanging in the air. One of the civil servants working in the building told me that the seemingly dying tree was still alive though he couldn’t say exactly when the leaves were to grow. For a period of time, I watered it every other day. Of course, it was useless. Some people considered me a fool because they thought the tree was just too old to live, while others observed that it must be the wooden platform that had prohibited it from getting sufficient rain and sunshine.</p><p>To our surprise, however, the dying tree started to change gradually due to the heavy rainfall from the late April till now.  It was not only alive but also thriving. Today, the tree is covered with leaves nearly one-fourth more than those of the other tree. I’m so full of joy every time I watch it getting greener and more prosperous than ever, feeling greatly amazed by its endurance and vitality.</p><p>*	*	*	*	*	*	*	* 	*	*	*	*  </p><p> </p><p>For the sake of my health, I bought a Huawei watch GT half a year ago and started walking around 15 minutes every day after dinner or at other leisure time. I made it a goal to walk 7500 steps a day to keep healthy. Strangely, the watch would show only  less than 300 steps after I had walked over 10 minutes. One of my friends thought that I needed to bring my smartphone with me while I was walking so that they might match before it could function. But it didn’t work, either, after I followed her suggestion.</p><p>One day, my husband and I went to the 101 Building for lunch. As I had always complained about my watch GT, he proposed to walk around the building and check if our watches were functioning. After our first circling, his watch displayed over 2000 steps, but mine just around 400. It again proved the malfunction of my watch. Then, my husband suggested us to switch our watches and walk again. To our surprise, the watch that belonged to me and was now worn by my husband showed 2300 steps, while the one that belonged to my husband and was now on my hand displayed just over 300 paces. Finally, the mystery was resolved! -- The problem of my watch has nothing to do with the watch itself; the trouble lies in the fact that I did not swing my arms high enough. The watch is able to sense it only if my arms swing to an angle of over 45 degrees while I am walking.</p><p>Right now, my watch always shows the number of steps that I have set up as a goal to reach when I take a walk outside. I’m full of joy, knowing how the technology improves my health.</p><p>*	*	*	*	*	*	*	* 	*	*	*	*  </p><p>“Welcome! Please have a seat! Enjoy yourself!” As soon as you get into the Wenshan Intern Living Hall restaurant (文山實習生活館) at Muzha, several young students of the Wenshan Special Education School, in apron, will greet you kindly and then clean the tables and serve the dishes. Since it is mainly for educational purpose rather than commercial interest, it is open in accordance with the school time, and besides weekends, it is closed on the days when the waiter-students went on a field trip.</p><p>Due to the delicious food, reasonable prices, and the graceful environment, the restaurant always has a full house.  In addition, it has also been favored by many groups as one of the top choices for lunch gathering. Certainly, it owes its success to its versatile chefs, efficient managers, and, most of all, the students’ good service for the customers. Whenever I have my lunch there, I’m full of joy.</p>
