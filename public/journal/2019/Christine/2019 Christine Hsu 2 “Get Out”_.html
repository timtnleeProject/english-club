<p><strong>July 24, 2019</strong></p><p><strong><em>“Get Out” </em></strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>The restaurant where I have my lunch for almost every working day offers a private dining room with a TV set and an air conditioner. I enjoy the noon time I spend there watching TV or movies on cell phone while having my lunch. The first movie I randomly selected was a horror movie named “Get Out.” It begins with  a scene where an African American walked on a street in the dark night and then was hit and dragged into a car, which immediately aroused my curiosity. I continued watching to find out what might happen next.</p><p>The protagonist,  Chris, was an African American, too. His girlfriend, Ross, a gorgeous-looking white woman, suddenly invited him to visit her parents. It made him very nervous though Ross promised him that her parents were not racists. Chris did not believe it until he saw how well her family treated the black maid and the black worker in her house. Later, however, when Chris had a chance to talk to the two black servants privately, he felt something weird. He tried to call one of his best friends, Rod, but failed because his phone was unplugged from the charging device. When the night came, Ross’s mother persuaded Chris that she could help him quit smoking if he allowed her to hypnotize him. It did work, but little did Chris know that it was the first step for the family to have his body transplanted to a blind old man.</p><p>The next day, Ross’s family held a big party. All the townspeople came and treated Chris in a very friendly manner. Among them, Chris noticed a black man whom he thought he had met before but could not identify because of the different way he dressed and talked. Chris then took a picture of the man and sent it to Rod. To their surprise, the man, as Rod found out, was a friend of theirs who had been missing for six months. (He was the one who was dragged into the car in the opening scene.) All of a sudden, Chris solved the puzzle and figured that he might be in danger, so he made an excuse to leave, which pushed Ross’s family to execute their plot earlier than planned. Instead of leaving Ross’s house, Chris was again hypnotized by her mother.</p><p>When Chris woke up, he found his hands and legs tied on a chair. In front of him was a TV showing a blind old man who was making a speech. From the speech, he learned that they were about to transplant the old man’s brain to his head and then he would no longer be himself, just like all the other black people in this town.</p><p>I was happy that Chris finally escaped from the horrible town at the end of the movie. I felt, however, extremely terrified after knowing that the two black servants were actually Ross’s grandparents, who had transplanted their brains to the victims in order to extend life.  Fortunately, it’s all just a movie.   </p>
