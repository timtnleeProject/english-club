<p><strong>May 2, 2019</strong></p><p><strong><em>What a Great Compensation </em></strong></p><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p>Every day I’ll get plenty of emails from my supervisor or my colleagues. Some are directly related to my job, but most others are just announcements. Checking them is a huge burden for me,  especially when I am extremely busy at work. But one day, I got one which aroused my interest greatly, and I could not wait to experience the website mentioned in that email.</p><p>It was sent by my boss, who sincerely promoted an online English learning website, expressing his regret that too few employees had been using it. I considered it a great gift for me to be able to learn English after work for free. I chose a 1 to 6 group class at the first time. The topic was telling a ghost story. To be honest, I was neither familiar nor interested in that topic, but I just wanted to experience an online course. Unfortunately, there were only one guy and I attending that class. When the class started, a slide showed the topic we were going to talk about. After our brief self-introduction, the second slide showed four pictures—a castle, a half-opened door, stairs with handrail, a person lying in a bed, and a knife with blood on it. We took turns to guess the message of each picture and told a reasonable ghost story. Since I hadn’t had the chance to speak English for months, my English was rusty. Naturally, I did not express myself well. Still, I attended two more classes lates, but I stopped after finding that none of my colleagues took advantage of it. For curiosity’s sake, I kept checking the class schedule and found some really interesting topics, so I decided to continue the classes again without caring about what other colleagues might think. </p><p>As I was not allowed to choose either teachers or classmates, sometimes the class could be boring, especially when some classmates reacted really slowly or did not speak clearly. Other times it could be very funny. For example, one time when we were learning how to make requests politely, Student A asked Student B, “Could you pass the cup for me?” Then Student B answered: “Sorry, it’s too far.” Student A mistakenly thought that Student B wanted him to get closer to the microphone, so he spoke again, loudly and slowly. Two of them did it for several times until the teacher turned on her microphone to solve the chaos. I could not help but laugh badly. </p><p>Besides joining group classes, I also booked a private class that I could only join once a week. It was different from group classes where students took turns to answer questions: during the 40 minutes I had to answer all the questions shown on the slides. It was great that I did not need to wait for other students to finish their talks, and the teacher would correct my sentences at the end if she found something wrong in my speech. </p><p>The job I’m taking now is not an easy one, so I’ve regarded this benefit as a compensation to comfort myself. I am happy to learn that some colleagues have also started taking classes, and to improve my English, I’ll definitely make consistent and effective use of the English learning website.</p>
