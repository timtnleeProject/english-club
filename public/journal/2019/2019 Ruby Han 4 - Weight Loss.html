<p><strong>Dec. 15, 2019</strong></p><p><strong><em>Weight Loss: A Success </em></strong></p><p><strong><em> 	</em></strong></p><p>Because I knew how to dress myself in such a way as to hide my big stomach, almost no one sensed that I had weight problems. Actually, although I felt I Was getting fatter and fatter, I hadn’t cared about it much. It was not until I could no longer squeeze myself into my favorite outfits did I decide to do something about it.</p><p>The first action I took is to keep a healthy diet: First, I reduced starch intake, including rice and food made from flour. I used to have a slice of toast for breakfast and a bowl of rice for lunch and dinner. Now, I cut down each meal into half or even less. Second, I would never eat food with saturated fat acid or any fat parts of pork, beef and chicken. Also, I tried to avoid delicate pastries, sugary drinks such as bubble tea, and fried food--due to the various kinds of oils, sugar and unknown additives they contain that may cause fat and impair health. Third, I would eat vegetables, fruits and eggs first and then meat, fish and other kinds of food. Milk is indispensable for its rich nutrition, so I would drink a glass of it every day to stay healthy.</p><p>The second action I took is to keep exercising regularly. Every day I would take a 30-minute walk around the Wenshan Park twice with the goal of 7,000 steps at a daily average, and I would measure my weight at Muzha Health Center, next the park. Heaven helps those who help themselves: My body weight has decreased from 55 down to 54, 53, and now, 52 kilograms. Although my big stomach is still there, it has shrunk a lot. I can again put on most of my old clothes, and wearing pants that previously seemed too tight no longer causes discomfort.</p><p>To sum up, keeping an eye on one’s diet and doing regular exercises not only keep one in good shape but also help one stay away from the three “hypers” -- hyperlipidemia, hypertension and hyperglycemia. It’s worth the effort because it’s killing two birds with one stone. </p>
