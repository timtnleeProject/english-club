<p><strong>May 7, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Evil Practice	</em></strong></p><p>I had never considered seriously quitting any bad habit of mine until I was addicted to computer games.</p><p>I used to think playing computer games all day was a waste of time. However, a few of my fellow workers had been taken by it since one of my coworkers introduced them to the pleasures of it. How magical it was that such an activity could lead them to neglect sleep and meals. I curiously gave it a try, which was the start of my nightmare. The game really looks dumb but interesting. Trying to win the game, I played it over and over and got some tips from it. Soon I was able to get higher grades than I first did. Since then, it seemed that I had been bewitched to play it all the time, most of which I squeezed out of my working hours. "No prosperity is gained without paying a price." Naturally, I spend considerable time practicing it just for the temporary excitement at every new scoring. Certainly, I wouldn't miss noon breaks. Every morning, when I stepped into the office and before I started any office work, I already expected noon break to come fast. All my coworkers hated to take turns to stay in the office during noon break, which was usually the time for them to run their personal errands. I, however, volunteered happily to replace their turns because it meant I would be able to play the more-than-one-hour video games without interruptions.</p><p>I was ever intoxicated by my newly broken record. All the time, the game filled my mind. On the bus and in the meeting I was always practicing it in my mind. Whenever and wherever, I researched whatever possible methods for winning. I became absent-minded in doing almost everything except playing the game. Every time I saw the mark of "game" on the tabletop of the computer I couldn't help but click it. Every day, I regretted my sickly obsession since my eyes felt extremely hurt, and I hated myself for lacking self-discipline. Every day, I told myself to get rid of it. But when I saw the game on the table, it nullified all the previous efforts of quitting it.</p><p>Most people are quite used to seeing things from their own point of view when blaming gamblers or druggies for lacking self-discipline, courage and determination. The truth is these indulgers were in the power of gambling or drugs. I don't think those accusers have ever experienced or tried to place themselves into those situations. They have no idea how difficult it is to extricate oneself from evil practices. With this horrible experience I underwent, I could picture how those indulgers must have struggled like I did but failed to escape. What's more, I no longer criticize people like them for I fully understand it's not easy at all to get rid of bad habits or evil practices.         </p>
