<p><strong>May 17, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>You're Special </em></strong></p><p>Do you know how many people in Taiwan have depression, a kind of mental disease? According to Department of Health Director Hou Shan-mou, there are around 700,000. Why did they get it? Because they couldn't handle different problems in their life regarding jobs and relationships. They doubted why they were born into the world. Worst of all, some of them committed suicides or even killed their entire family members before they killed themselves.</p><p>The song below tells us that we are all special. You might think you are not smart, beautiful or significant. But in fact, no matter who you are, you are special to your family, your friends, and even your teachers or your students. They love you and care about you. You are, as the song suggests, "a unique design." Be confident in yourself and do your best. Help your family with household chores or do volunteer work for your community. You are important for your family and society. Don't just sit and think all day long; you need to be active. If you work as hard as you can, by all means you are special.</p><p><em>You are special			</em></p><p><em>You're one of a kind</em></p><p><em>You're one of a kind		</em></p><p><em>All of the time</em></p><p><em>You're an original			</em></p><p><em>Be the best you</em></p><p><em>A unique design			</em></p><p><em>And you'll be fine, and then you'll shine</em></p><p><em>You don't have to prove it	</em></p><p><em>You're one of a kind</em></p>
