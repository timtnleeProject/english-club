<p><strong>Apr. 21, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Another Canadian</em></strong></p><p>Branka was the second Canadian bone marrow courier I received. To my great surprise, the first one, Luara, was one of her good friends.</p><p>What Branka told me surprised me even more. Once Laura knew that Branka would come to Taiwan to take the bone marrow, she told Branka how happy she had been during her stay in Taiwan and how kind we Tzu Chi volunteers were. She enjoyed all the things we had done for her and she could not wait to come back to Taiwan. Her compliments about us and Taiwan aroused Branka's great interest in visiting us.</p><p>Due to the unpredictable weather, Branka left Hualien three hours earlier than scheduled and arrived in Taipei at 2 p.m. There was still 10 hours before her departure from Taiwan to Canada. After discussing it with one of the Foreign Language Team members, I decided to bring her to visit Daai TV Station as we had a humanity exhibition for Tzu Chi's 40th anniversary. Through the exhibition, Branka got to know more about the history of Tzu Chi Foundation and Daai TV Station. Another volunteer John helped to introduce some Tzu Chi groups, such as Tzu Chi Police Team, Foreign Language Team, and Honor Broad Chairmen, a group built by people who had donated NT$1 million to the Tzu Chi Foundation. In the exhibition room, Branka was so glad to see her country's flag on a huge post showing how many bone marrow couriers had taken matched marrow from Taiwan during the past 10 years. The case Branka took would be recorded in Tzu Chi's history, too.</p><p>Xin-Dian Hospital caught Branka's sight as soon as she got into the hall. It was a big wall post made of over two million mosaic tiles, on which was told a story about Buddha taking good care of a sick disciple. Like other visitors, Branka did not think the hospital was a hospital but a unique building with its fabulous architecture. She took lots of pictures at the lobby and more pictures for every cuisine at the cafeteria. She kept saying that she would show those pictures to Laura and tell her what amazing things she had seen in Taiwan, how touched she was after knowing what Master Cheng Yen had done for people all over the world, and how overwhelmed she was by our hospitality.</p><p>I always thought the things we did for the bone marrow couriers would not be known by the third party, so when I knew that Laura shared it with Branka, my happiness was beyond words. How amazing that I could be part of their mutual memory of the trip to Taiwan.</p><p>As Branka planned it, she came back after one month. This time I took her to the Shilin night market and the National Palace Museum. What's more, we enjoyed special vegetarian cuisine at the Sunshine restaurant. How rare it is to meet twice in two months a person who actually lives so far from me. I believed it was our good karma that brought us together. How amazing!</p>
