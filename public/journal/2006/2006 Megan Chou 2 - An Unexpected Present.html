<p><strong>Oct. 18, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>An Unexpected Present</em></strong></p><p>    </p><p>To kill time, I take a course on bonsai in Wen-Shan Community University. I absolutely enjoy seeing beautiful flowers and herbaceous plants, but not embedding those complicated plants. My husband, however, expects me to learn how to build a comfortable garden for our new house in Chung-Li City, where we are going to move next July.</p><p>As usual, I went to class on time this Tuesday morning. Mr. Tu, good at potted plant, and serving at National Palace Museum, was ready to prune the azalea brought by a student, a senior pruner. I have to admit that bonsai is an amazing art, as the pot showed immediately unique features after Mr. Tu's pruning. The clutter of sticks in the pot turned into a sylphlike statue. How magical it is!</p><p>Afterwards, Mr. Tu demonstrated how to move plants from a pot to another to better their growth. The sample plant he brought was a species of Haworthia, a kind of cactus. When showing us the plant, he asked us, "How can we move away cacti without hurting its acanthi? Whoever gives the correct answer will get this plant as a prize." None of us was sitting there without trying. Popping up were one after another inconceivable answer: fish web, cloth, paper board, plastic gloves, and cotton gloves, etc. Mr. Tu hinted that it was something easily seen in our daily life. Many possibilities came up to me. But it has to be both hard and soft. What things have such a quality? Two little brooms? Two helmets? Wait a second! Helmets... How about Styrofoam? It is both hard and soft!... Ya! My Goodness! I am definitely right! A piece of Styrofoam is the most suitable material to hold any kind of cactus safely without hurting the plant's acanthi.</p><p>I am very happy and satisfied with the prize I took home although I wonder whether I could take good care of it. Maybe it serves as a motive to urge me to learn harder about bonsai, which will help better my new living environment.</p>
