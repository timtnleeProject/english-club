<p><strong>Mar. 24, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>A Supportive Group</em></strong></p><p>  </p><p>Last Saturday I attended a meeting with some breast cancer patients at Wan Fang Hospital. Besides patients, there were also doctors, nurses, social workers and three enthusiastic volunteers from an association located in Tai Chung to share with us their experiences of establishing their association 12 years ago.</p><p>To found a support group to help breast cancer patients had been my dream when I was very sick at Wan Fang Hospital five years ago. I told my surgeon when I just finished the surgery, "You can't treat me like a patient who has her cecum respected. I need more care." After a few days, the doctor assigned his first breast cancer patient to visit me. But to gather more patients to visit and help new patients was what I wished most.</p><p>During these five years, every time I went to have my medical check, I would ask my surgeon when they would have a gathering for all patients. So when I knew that they finally took the first step, I was so happy that I could not wait to meet all the other patients. After the first gathering, they planned to have a press conference on April 8, in which they would announce the founding of the patients' support group and gather all patients who had received treatment at Wan Fang Hospital.</p><p>"We must have been family in our previous lives. We meet again as we have one thing in common--a breast lost forever." I nearly burst into tears when I read this slogan from a book brought by the three volunteers. Suddenly, I felt so close to other patients. I thought to myself that they and I would need one another's care and we must help new patients hand in hand in the future.</p>
