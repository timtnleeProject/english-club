<p><strong>Oct. 16, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Photography Class</em></strong></p><p>No matter where I visit for spending my holidays, I would take pictures of almost everything, from the meal I have to the people I meet. But I had never thought that I would actually attend a photography class.</p><p>Three months ago, Joy, one of my good friends in the Tzu Chi Foundation, invited me to join a photography class which excited me with the variety and richness in its content. It, however, conflicted with my sign-language class, and I was worried that, without a single-lens camera, I might have trouble meeting the demand of the class. I told Joy my worries. She comforted me by saying that she too had not had a professional camera when taking her first photography class, but in the end, her work turned out to rank third place in the whole class with its "perfect composition." Because of this experience sharing, I finally got the courage to register for the class.</p><p>The class was much better than I had expected. Our teacher spent much time making the handouts as well as demonstrating sample pictures to help us understand the related theory. His wife, also his assistant, would divide all students into 12 teams, each with a volunteer instructor, and she would mail beforehand the class schedule along with the handout. During class time, she was always busy in and out of the room to set up the audio equipment or prepare tea and dessert for our break time. Seeing her sweating in an air-conditioned room, I felt thankful for the lovely couple's great devotion and wholehearted contribution. How lucky we were to have them.</p><p>Besides learning theories on photography, we also practiced shooting pictures outdoors on every Saturday or Sunday. Knowing my camera's aperture and shutter were not adjustable, Alice, an instructor outside my team, lent me her camera for practice and later offered valuable opinions on pictures I had taken. It was not the only favor she did for me. Once when we went to the Confucius Temple, she even asked another instructor to comment on my pictures. I learned so much from them, not only the photographic skills but also their unselfishness.</p><p>Before the last class, I completed the questionnaire and wrote down my gratitude. Though I had to give up sign-language class for photography lessons, what I have gained is far more than what I might have lost.</p>
