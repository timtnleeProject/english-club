<p><strong>Nov. 3, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Using Someone</em></strong></p><p>A common matter happens around people everyday—using someone. Sometimes you do it without knowing because it happens so naturally, but at times you do it on purpose for personal gains, like when you asked your family to dump the garbage on his way out; or asked your spouse to prepare a delicious meal for your friends.</p><p>Confucius had said, “If three of us are walking together, at least one of the other two is good enough to be my teacher”. To learn to be vigilant, it is important and necessary to take advantage of someone to help you become better. If everyone has the desire for positive improvement, the world will make significant progress. In fact, numerous examples can be found in daily life. When you try to improve your English ability, you may be taught by English experts and you may practice conversations with friends. That’s a good way for you to better yourself by taking advantage of others.</p><p>Some people refuse to ‘use’ anybody under whatever circumstances. They insist on dealing with things or complete work all by themselves. They, however, may pay their price by spending more time than necessary to finish work or living with imperfect results. Not using anyone at all, I think, shows a lack of flexibility. When we have a trip to a strange country, we need a tour guide to help us understand the place and enjoy the journey easily; on the other hand, the guide needs us tourists to earn his living and find his own value by doing what he is good at. A successful mountain hiking activity needs lots of people to attend, while the hikers have fun and improve their health. Using others is inevitable and can be reciprocal.</p><p>Using someone for healthy motives is acceptable, as long as one gets hurt in the process. In this competitive environment, it is not unusual for us to witness selfishness, fraud, deception, and treachery, and yet if we keep an appreciative and grateful heart as well as a respectful and moral attitude, using others is never the same as exploiting them.</p>
