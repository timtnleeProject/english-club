<p><strong>Mar. 10, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Random Reflection on a Movie</em></strong></p><p>I seldom watch movies. Basically, I think it’s a waste of time. Is the movie good? Is the story complete and significant? What’s the intention of the director? Few moviegoers think about these questions. They just feel the movie is good. I just like it, they say. Eventually they just insensibly accept whatever concepts, good or bad, inside the movie.</p><p>Not long ago I went to a movie called Fearless with a friend. Before watching it, I had known its storyline. The leading actor was Jet Lee, who had been engaged in spiritual practice for a period of time. It was about a Chinese martial art master, Fou Yen Giar, a kung-fu master matchless anywhere in the world. The fame made him more and more arrogant. He wanted to pursue the No. 1, which even drove him to kill a person.</p><p>But after some happenings he gained self-awareness and changed. He turned himself into a very humble and merciful person. Instead of killing, he saved the lives of his rivals. With his compassion for them, we, the audience, know he has grown into a true hero.</p><p>I think I have learned something from the movie. To be arrogant will cause troubles. Be humble and merciful, and we can avoid evil. I also like some dialogues in the movie, especially those in the scene when the master approached his rival before the competition. They were drinking tea. His Japanese rival said to him, this is the most excellent tea. The master answered, tea, coming from great nature, is neither good nor bad. It’s people who discriminate against them. Good words. But on the other hand, the movie is overall rather violent, which, I thought, was the sole shortcoming of the movie.</p><p>People can be easily influenced by movies. So it is very important to select a good movie to watch. This movie, in my opinion, does more good than bad. If you are an adult who is comparatively less inclined to be influenced by the violence on the screen, you are encouraged to see the movie for you are bound to learn something from it.</p>
