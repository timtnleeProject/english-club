<p><strong>Oct. 16, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Learning from Planning an Activity</em></strong></p><p>Besides Tzu Chi Foundation, I also work as a volunteer for Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation and Wang-Fan Hospital. I have hosted lots of activities, but none of them is as difficult as the one I did for the 15th anniversary of Tzu Chi Foreign Language Team (FLT).</p><p>As I had only joined FLT for three years, I had no idea about its anniversary until I was assigned to plan its celebration. After cautious consideration, we decided to postpone it for one month to better prepare ourselves.</p><p>A lot of ideas kept pounding in my mind and it was very hard to get a conclusion as most of the other volunteers did not offer their opinions. Finally, I decided the people might like to know what the FLT had done in the past 15 years, so I required all members to provide their pictures with captions. The idea was to have some senior members shown in those pictures tell us some interesting or touching stories, and to have the leader of FLT make a speech of our future plans. Most of our members agreed it was a good plan until we finally got the chance to discuss it together. I did not remember how much time I had spent planning it, but I did remember how swiftly they nullified it in one night.</p><p>First of all, our leader had already got a file which he thought was a perfect one for presenting FLT's history. Second, they did not think those seniors' experience-sharing would be interesting. They came up with a completely new agenda and added two sign-language song performances. It meant that I had to gather volunteers to work on this last-minute idea. I was upset by the new task burdened on me, and confused too--I always thought that our team should perform something related to English, not sign-language, as our team was named.</p><p>It took me one week to convince myself that the plan they made was better than mine though I was really frustrated and was skeptical about my ability. By participating in these meetings, I realized that no matter which plan we adopted for the 15th anniversary, the sun would still rise up from the east every day. I should not take it so seriously as to make myself unhappy. We may not achieve 100-percent success, but we may as well enjoy the 60-percent we can get.</p>
