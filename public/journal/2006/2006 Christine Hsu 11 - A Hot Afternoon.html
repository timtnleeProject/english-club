<p><strong>Sep. 15, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Hot Afternoon</em></strong></p><p>It was hot last Tuesday. Soon after finishing lunch, I rushed to Tzu Chi Taipei branch office to get the Korean soap opera DVD which I borrowed from a member of the Foreign Language Team. While I was ready to leave there, an elderly of my mother's age walked to me and asked me how to get to Taipei City Library. After telling her where to get the bus, I quickly jumped onto my motorcycle. But a thought stopped me from leaving.</p><p>I thought that it was cruel to have an elderly walk so far to take the bus under the scorching sun, so I stopped and returned to ask that lady if I could give her a ride. She answered delightedly, "Of course, if you have another helmet."</p><p>On the way to the library, she told me that she had attended a storytelling class at Taipei chapter and would join a Hakka-affair meeting hosted by Mayor Ma at the library. She has been working as a volunteer for the Hakka broadcasting station for a few years. It really surprised me to find that I actually met a Tzu Chi volunteer who was Hakka and happened to live in Mu-Cha, just like me. If I had just left her behind, I would not have gotten the chance to know her--n enthusiastic lady who devoted herself to developing Hakka culture.</p><p>I was so glad to have made a right choice. She could not stop thanking me with her body bending down. To her, my favor seemed like a glass of water in the desert and a pile of charcoal fire in the winter, but for me, it was such an easy thing to do. The feeling of boundless happiness was a bonus for me. My team leader's words, said at my home two weeks ago, suddenly emerged out of my mind, "Only when you put your whole heart to help others first, can you get the endless joyfulness." Those words had meant little to me until I gave that lady a ride. Even now, that lady's grateful smile still satisfies and cheers me.</p>
