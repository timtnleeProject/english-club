<p><strong>Oct. 17, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Who Is to Blame?</em></strong></p><p>I was so sorry for Zhao Jian-ming when I saw him getting so fat and being downcast on TV or in the newspapers, compared with his previously tall and handsome figure. Some doctors estimated that he had gained at least 20 kilograms ever since the exposure of the inside trade scandal. In order to avoid the chase of the media, he confined himself at home all day long for nearly half a year. What's worse, the screening committee of Tai Da (National Taiwan University) Hospital had rejected his reinstatement application.</p><p>It was reported that Chao had emphasized in his application letter: "It's you who wanted me to return Tai Da; it's you who wanted me to be chief of doctors." Almost every committee member thought Chao showed little regret for his mistakes, so only one voted for his return while the rest of 57 were against it. So who is the "you" anyway? Obviously the "you" is Hou Sheng-mao, who was the chief of Osteopathy back then, and now the Minister of Health Department.</p><p>People still remembered that Chao never went to his office in Tai Da during the time when SARS swept over Taiwan island-wide. President Chen's daughter, Chen Xing-yu, told the media the other day that they had simply followed the instruction of their boss. So who was their boss? It was Hou Sheng-mao, too.</p><p>Chao skipped grades in his promotion and enjoyed having just for himself a big office with a beautiful view and an operation room in Tai Da Hospital. Why could he have all those privileges? To quote the chief of the double care sick room of surgery, Ke Wen-che , "Tai Da is to blame for what Chao had done." Chao refuted by saying that he had never violated any hospital regulations. Yes, all those privileges were granted by the flattery high rank officials who treated principles as dirt.</p><p>It was further reported that someone gave Chao an over NT$1,000,000 brand cape as his son's one-year-old birthday present. The renowned entrepreneur of the Kus bought a famous brand watch worth over NT$2,000,000 to President Chen's son Chen Zhi-zhong as a wedding gift. "My President, you are my chocolate!" The police students shouted loudly to President Chen in early October during his visit to the police school.</p><p>Flattery has become a common phenomenon, or even part of a culture, in the officialdom. They did not care about the established system of hiring and firing officials. Whoever is in favor--capable or not, virtuous or not--will be hired and get promoted surprisingly fast. An interesting example is former Economics Minster Zong Tsai-yi. Because she was not well-prepared for her new job and had no clue what she should be doing, she stayed in her position for only 48 days. Some officials are incompetent, while others are taking bribes, which leads to scandalous cases such as the building of Snow Mountain Tunnel and the ETC electronic tolling. All in all, the government's executive efficiency is deteriorating because of the absurd situation where professionals are led and thus wasted by a bunch of laymen who are deeply corrupt government officials.</p><p>I think we need to be thankful to our ancestors whose efforts have made our life much easier.</p>
