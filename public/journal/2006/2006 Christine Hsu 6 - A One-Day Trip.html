<p><strong>May 12, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>A One-Day Trip</em></strong></p><p>  </p><p>It was the first time I invited my best friends from the Tzu Chi Foreign Language Team to go swimming and hiking. My husband and I discussed the hiking path. Finally we chose a comparably easier one with trees on its both sides which shaped like a small tunnel. My family had even gone there one week before to check where to rest and where to admire the splendid scenery. Furthermore, I thought up different options to go along with different weather conditions, as it had been raining for almost a week.</p><p>The day finally came! It was supposed to rain all day long according to the weather forecast, but to our great surprise, it stopped raining past noon. Seems my prayer did work.</p><p>Due to the morning rain there were fewer people than usual in the swimming pool and so we all enjoyed the SPA and swimming to our hearts' content. For the sake of accompanying friends, I did not swim as much as I usually did. It was more interesting to enjoy SPA with friends. I was really grateful for their coming on a rainy day.</p><p>"Lunch" was what we needed most after swimming. The restaurant was not crowded as usual. I felt there was Someone arranging everything well for all of us. Most of us were exhausted after a laborious swim, and felt sleepy after a great meal, but we decided to still explore the beautiful scenery up the mountain.</p><p>It was really hard for us to get free time and get together to have such relaxing activities. Maybe we all got weary legs, but I did feel very comfortable and satisfied. We even planned for our next hike in the near future. I thought this was a great opportunity for us to talk and share our feelings and observations not only about our lives but also our work at Tzu Chi. Life is always wonderful to have good friends together.</p><p>No goodness could be achieved by one person alone. Because of the generosity of my two good friends, Lillien and Jennifer, who gave me their swimming tickets, I was able to arrange and enjoy this great trip.</p>
