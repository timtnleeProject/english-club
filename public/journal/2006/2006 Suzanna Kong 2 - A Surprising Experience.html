<p><strong>Nov. 2, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Surprising Experience</em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>A few years ago, one of my friends intended to introduce a young man to my son's teacher, and so arranged a dinner appointment at a Japanese restaurant. Before the day, he asked us through my friend how we would get there and if we could give him a ride because his car was under repair in a garage. Of course we said "No."</p><p>Then on that day when we got there, the young man had arrived by bus. Later in our conversation, he said he had 45 credit cards and took out six cell phones from his suitcase. Though he told us his different needs for each phone, we were really astonished by his weird pattern of behavior. He continued to say he always looked for abandoned cars on the roadside so that he could earn an extra $500 from each car after he had reported it to the authorities. With our eyes wide open, my husband and I and my son's teacher could not believe what we had heard and were greatly puzzled by the man sitting in front of us, who was all ridiculous and unpleasant.</p><p>Further annoyingly, it was not he but his aunt, accompanying him for the date, who had paid the bill for the meal. The set dinner was only $180 per person, but he was stingy enough not to stand the treat. It is a big question, we all agreed later, how a man like him would ever get himself a girlfriend, not to mention a life-long partner.</p>
