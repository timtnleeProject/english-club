<p><strong>Sep. 14, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Lifestyle of Mine</em></strong></p><p>   </p><p>Quitting my previous job, I have taken up again my old role of a housewife to play; meanwhile, I have much more free time than ever. Friends' advice keeps echoing around me: "A part-time job may be good for you" or "Why do you need to work when you have a rich husband?" Actually, I am rather confused by these voices. Anyway, I am going to learn more interesting things before any decision is made by the end of this year.</p><p>English learning is my favorite hobby although it is hard work sometimes. I am lucky to have a group of friends who share the same hobby as mine, so I will continue to enhance my language ability. There are another three subjects I chose from Wen-Shan Community University to study: "Appreciating Classic Music," "Planting and Gardening," and "Yoga and Meditation." These are subjects that help release one's mental pressure. The near-future goal I set up is to build a personal blog through which I will apply the knowledge and experience I have been learning from the 5-month-long class offered by the Wen-Shan Community University.</p><p>Time flies, but I can catch the wonderful feelings from doing what I love to do. Enjoying the small details of life is the most important task for seeking happiness.</p>
