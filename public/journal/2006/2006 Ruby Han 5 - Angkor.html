<p><strong>Sep. 6, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Angkor </em></strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>You cannot help but be astonished while you are stopping at the great Angkor. Being so magnificent and delicate, the Angkor is one of the seven wonders in the world. The amazing stone-city was constructed in the 8<sup>th</sup> century and ruined by Thai people in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. From then on, the Angkor had been disappearing over several hundreds of years until a French explorer found it by following the guides of a Chinese ancient book named Customs and Practices in ZhenLa, or Ancient Cambodia.</p><p>With an area of 200 square kilometers and surrounded by a 119-meter-long river, Angkor is a huge body of construction equal to the size of Taipei Wenshan District. With its beautiful and creative designs and grandeur architecture, it is more crowded than Seamenting nearly all year long, attracting a lot of Westerners who are especially interested in ancient culture.</p><p>The huge head-lifting fierce snake winds the roof of temples. On the top of the wall carved out were a series of ancient legends or daily life events such as armed soldiers fighting enemies, or a baby being delivered with all sorts of tools. Whoever watches these carvings is to be impressed by this great Angkor.</p><p>Although Cambodia had a splendid culture in the past, it has declined by now. Beggars in shabby clothes are everywhere in this country. Maybe to avoid the flood, people live in high-legged but very simple houses. Drinking, eating, washing and excreting on the river, many people reside in small and dirty boats as their permanent home. They lead a backward life with no wire, no running water, and no sewage, the last of which easily results in a flood after heavy rain. The first day of our trip, we came across a small-scale flood outside the imperial palaces when we visited them.</p><p>Except in the capital of Phnom Penh, the entire country has few traffic lights. Even in such sightseeing areas as Angkor, in the Siem Reap province, only three traffic lights can be found. Many cars without plates run freely on the streets. Motorcyclists wear no helmets and carry as many passengers as they like.</p><p>The vendors sold lots of strange stuff like fried spiders or crickets as snacks, which, according to my tour guide, are delicious food for native people. Amazingly, a plenty of children with their clothes on were playing and swimming in the large muddy pool near which no warning sign could be seen. All these scenes we witnessed are like pictures taken in Taiwan five decades ago. </p>
