<p><strong>Dec. 7, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Mercy in My Heart</em></strong></p><p>One of my English Club members, Christine, who has a clever and sharp-eyed appearance, not only speaks directly without reserve and without nonsensical words, but also has speedy, logical thinking and unconventional behaviors. If I were a superintendent, I would definitely want to hire her as my important coworker. Actually, she has been the leader of the English Club for 5 years. Being her friend, I am able to penetrate her misleading appearance and perceive her goodness of heart, which I respect and admire a great deal. Because of her, I have learned that to treat this world with mercy can help me see something good in everything. Consequently, happy emotions will float in me unconsciously.</p><p>I like her straightforwardness and honesty. She is not at all like most other women who always hesitate in revealing opinions. From her journals, I know she is a volunteer of the Tzu-Chi Foundation. This is out of my expectations! She is easily mistaken for a toughie, and so people can hardly relate her to the Zen-Yen master, who is elegance and grace itself.</p><p>A few days ago, after our visit to Taitung, Ellis and I felt like buying a basket of fruit (shih-ja) on the way home, which cost NT$100. The vendor, an old woman, suggested we spend the extra NT$180 to buy other 'better' basketry fruits instead. At first, I was not very comfortable about the suggestion, but later I thought an old woman with such a kind appearance as hers could not be deceptive, and so I took a pile of fruit she offered me. But later when I opened the basket in the car, I could not stop storming at the old woman's dissimulation. She had told a big lie: most of the fruit were rotten. I felt infuriated and lost my temper because I could not tolerate the woman to abuse my sympathy. Ellis, another slap happy friend of mine, advises me not to be angry at the woman but have mercy at heart instead. The knot in me will untie itself as long as I give up the wishful thinking that I expect the woman to have been honest.</p><p>A person's inside does not always go with his outside appearance. It is limited as to what we can do to improve our appearance, but we can at least cultivate our mind by staying out of greed.</p>
