<p><strong>Sep. 1, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Forever</em></strong></p><p>When I was a little girl I had always believed that I would live with my parents and sisters together forever. But soon we grew up and left home for school and job. Then I thought that I would have a world of myself forever. Soon, however, I got married. I had no doubt about my girlhood dream that my husband would love me forever, until it proved untrue. Every time I believed in "forever," it failed me. What is "forever"? It simply does not exist.</p><p>All mothers think their children will rely on them forever but it is foolish thinking. Remember clearly: let go when they have grown up. But I still ask the questions that all other mothers are asking. Why is everything temporary? Why couldn't we hold on to anything but are losing all gradually? Why couldn't we have happiness all the time but have to suffer sadness?  </p><p>We should all remain doubtful when someone uses the word "forever," because it is an impossible word. When people say "no problem," it often means "a lot of problems." It's foolish to believe that good fate stays forever with us. We must face the fact that we are bound to lose things or people we think forever belong to us. Why don't we simply enjoy the time when we still have them and keep them in our memory--the only place to find "forever" possible.</p>
