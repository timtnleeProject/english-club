<p><strong>May 8, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Suicide of Ni Min-ran</em></strong></p><p>A few days ago, the family of famous entertainer Mr. Ni Min-ran 倪敏然, who had been missing for weeks, pled the public to help their search of him. Unfortunately, someone found him hanging himself on a tree at a remote place in I-lan County.</p><p>Ni Min-ran was a remarkable comedian in various sitcoms, variety shows and stand-up performances. People were deeply impressed by the role he played as a Mr. Seven in 1983 and his mock show of Vice President Annette Lu in the early 2000. While he was on the top of his success, his schedule was full, sometimes with 11 shows a day. In 2001, he got the Golden Bell award as the best host and actor. What a wonderful, sparkling life! What now?</p><p>As a matter of fact, the sad story happened not just to him. Many celebrities in the movie or sports world would lead an unhappy life. Hong Kong big movie star and singer Chang Kou-rung jumped from a high building several years ago. Actress Le Di, who was the main actress in the famous film "Liang Shan-bo and Zhu Ying-tai" and Lin Dai, who used to be a queen actress in Asia, both killed themselves by taking overdose of sleeping pills while they were still young. Vivien Leigh, starring in "Gone with the Wind," and Marlon Brando in "Godfather," both Hollywood giants, led a tragic life in their later years too.</p><p>Those great stars all earned much money easily when they were enjoying their good luck. Because they did not know how to manage their money wisely and protect themselves from the complicated entertainment world or bad friends, they were apt to indulge themselves in excessive drinking, drugging, gambling or having extra-marital affairs. They failed to control their life well, which naturally led to an unhappy end for most of them.</p><p>We do not need to envy their colorful life. Beneath their glory and fame, there are actually more tears and sadness than we can imagine. Not many are fit for the life of dramatic rise and fall. Ordinariness can be a blessing. If we are well responsible for ourselves, we will lead a simple but happy life.</p>
