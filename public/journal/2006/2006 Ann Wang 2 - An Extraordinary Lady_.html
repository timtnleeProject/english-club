<p><strong>June 15, 2006  </strong></p><p><strong><em>An Extraordinary Lady</em></strong></p><p>She is a young single lady who is good-looking and in good shape but rather short, appearing unfriendly and even a little proud. I haven't had a chance to compliment her about her appearance but just have appreciated her from a distance, through the exchange of our eyes. Often, she acts like she knows that inevitably, she becomes the focus of attention: the side of the swimming pool is her stage where she spends considerable time and moves with her assured poise. It's her daily work. Sometimes you can see her swim a few trips. I admire her for knowing the importance of health at such a young age.</p><p>It is easy to perceive that she seldom converses with anyone but men. I had never heard about her until she became the central topic of conversations among the regular visitors here, most of whom were the swimming club members. It was said that she had once blamed someone so severely that he was forced to retreat outside the building. As I overheard some members discussing her while taking a heat sauna, the idea flashed in my brain fast: "Was it sexual harassment?" I wondered but kept silent. I am not used to prying into others. The members continued to tell how two lifeguards had been forced to resign because of her, how she would start blaming others for no reason, and that all these must have been caused by her melancholia. I couldn't believe what I heard. Thinking it was just gossip, I assured myself that the woman looked extremely normal.   </p><p>I have always been afraid of water, and lately, since a man was reported to have drowned in the pool, I felt even more frightened when there were few swimmers except myself. Some members simply stopped coming, and I was quite preoccupied with the thought of the dead man although I had never seen him. I took a heat sauna instead of swimming because I felt bad being alone in the pool. There, I met a friend of mine. Naturally, our conversation centered on that horrifying accident. She told me most of it and mentioned another accident, too, which had happened about half a year ago--a man died in the men's shower room after exercising on the treadmill. Just before my friend was able to finish her story, the lady with the extraordinary appearance mentioned above opened the door and walked in right through between us two. We greeted her with a courtesy nod and went on chatting about the two dead men. My friend, who had known them, asked me if I had ever seen them. "No, I knew neither of the two," I replied. Right at the moment I gave out my answer, the lady, while stretching behind my friend, said sharply, "Mrs. Whoever-You-Are, a caustic wit like you would be the least person the two men wanted to know." Uttering these words sullenly, she walked out of the room, again right through between the two of us, to our great surprise. The air seemed to have quickly frozen as we realized what she had said. How strange she is! "She was aiming at you, but it was I who was doing the talking! You wouldn't mind what she had said, would you?" Of course not! She had hardly upset me but only proved how sick she had been.</p><p>God had joked on her cruelly. I was filled with a feeling of pity when I heard several months ago that she had breast cancer. What a big disaster it must have been for a pretty young girl like her. However, I discovered that she later shaved her head and naturally warmed up her body on the side of the pool as usual and totally neglected people's strange and annoying stares. This is certainly not an easy thing to do, not unless she had fully accepted her fate and made herself psychologically prepared. She is such an extraordinary person to show no uneasiness or anxiety but seriously and calmly face whatever lies ahead.</p>
