<p><strong>Feb. 18, 2006       </strong></p><p><strong><em>Choice</em></strong></p><p>If you are a rich parent, will you give our consent to your son's marriage with a divorced woman with two children and seven years older than your son? Of course not! The mother pleaded with the woman who had robbed her son of his freedom, but it seemed useless. Her son was stupid enough to be cheated by that bad woman. She could have kept her good, clever and lovely son forever. How could he disobey her just for such an evil woman, after she had tried so hard to raise and educate him, who now had a master degree? How could that kind of woman ever enter her house? She never stopped trying to find an elegant girl to match her excellent son. How could this kind of low class woman ever marry her son? She vows to do regular exercises and go to hot springs often to keep a long life, so as to prevent the rotten woman from getting hold of her son.</p><p>It is very strange that a woman who is not so young, not so slender and not so pretty can get such a nice young man's heart. Is the young man blind? It is very difficult to solve the knot between two women who love the same man. Who is more important, Mother or Lover? Why does the idiotic woman refuse to let go of the man whose parents reject their union? For money or for love?</p><p>We must let go of our children when they have grown up. We must respect their choice of study, career and marriage. Surely we have our obligations to advise them and make them 'see' the better options but they are the ones to make their own final decision and to take the consequences accordingly themselves.                </p>
