<p><strong>Apr. 24, 2006</strong></p><p><strong><em>Mosquitoes </em></strong></p><p>I hated mosquitoes buzzing around my head or giving me a bite when I was sleeping. I got up to kill them but could not find where they were. After I went back to sleep, they would keep buzzing and stinging me again in the dark. If I turned the light on, they would fly away. Getting up, falling asleep, and turning on and off the light all night long almost drove me mad.</p><p>I had tried a lot of ways to keep the mosquitoes away, like lighting incense, spraying the DDT or using the electric pad to kill them, but all in vain. Finally, I thought if I moved to the 13<sup>th</sup> floor, I might just be able to stay away from mosquitoes forever. Unfortunately, it did not work. The mosquitoes knew how to ride the elevator to my flat. So this annoying problem remained.</p><p>One day I asked all my friends if there was a way to solve this mosquitoes-related problem. A lot of suggestions came out. Assessing all of those ways, I thought that using a mosquito-net is the best way of all, and most natural, too. I would not have to use chemical substances whose smell would be bad for my lungs.</p><p>But how to hang it in my small bedroom and how to drive four nails into the wall without damaging it were real problems. Hanging it up at night and taking it off in the day-time could avoid making the room appear crowded. But how to nail it to the wall was still a big issue for me. Actually, I hated driving any nails on the wall.</p><p>Luckily, one day I found at a shopping mall a sort of moveable nail, which can be fixed to any kind of walls made of wood or glass or even concrete. I bought some at home and tried them on in my bedroom. Thanks to advanced technology, it works perfectly. Now, I have a good sleep every night. Would you want to try it?</p>
