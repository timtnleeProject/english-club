<p><strong>June 23, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Great City</em></strong></p><p>Over 1,000 elderly people gathered at the Wenshan Sports Center for the annual Sports Talent Competition. Both older women and men are equally excited, the former doing make-up for each other while the latter wearing scarfs or plastic bracelets. A total of 23 teams did their best to stage performances full of energy and heat. My husband’s 78-year-old teacher led her team to win third place. One of her students lifting a big health slogan was 94 years old. All of them were healthy and very happy to take part in this activity, from which we witnessed thousands of elderly people living a life of health and sustainability in 12 districts of Taipei. How great it is! No wonder former mayor Hau Lung-bin would get exhausted after calling on all centenarians in Taipei on the Double Ninth Festival. </p><p>For the health of its citizens, the Taipei City Government has built a Sports Center in each of the 12 districts. It provides all kinds of facilities and services, including a swimming pool, gym, dancing class, rock-climbing, badminton court, shooting range, golf course, roller skating rink and sauna chamber. They have everything that you expect to find.</p><p>There are lots of advanced cities to have public bike systems, such as Paris, Stockholm, New York, Washington, London, Hangzhou, Melbourne, Vienna and Taipei. The people could rent a bike at one station and give it back at another. It is usually free for the first hour, but afterwards it costs 3 dollars per hour in America, 1 euro in Paris, and 2 euros in Lyon. Because it is so cheap and convenient, U-bike becomes a common tool for transportation and exercise in Taipei. Seeing many people riding the bike on the street, you’ll feel that Taipei is an energetic and environmentally-friendly city.</p><p>Children will be the backbone of our country in the future, so the government attaches great importance to them. Twelve Indoor Playgrounds located in the 12 districts provide various services including a space for infant babies to practice walking, a reading area for parents and children, an area for exploration and adventures, a DIY section, and a stage for children to perform. Best of all are the reputed Taipei City libraries where you can stay for free all day long.</p><p>	</p><p>The 1999 Citizen HotLine, a direct communication channel between the city government and people, is really beyond praise. Through this line, the government drew a zebra line at the Section 3 of Muzha Road before the Mu-ha bus station, repaired all of the lights and turned them on at the Muzha Park at night again. Around March this year, while I was taking a walk, I found some Semen Cuscutae spread and fastened itself on the short trees of the crest trails along the embankment (in Alley 161 in Section 3 of Mu-hsing Road). After I called 1999, they sent me an email immediately and told me what time they would go to deal with the problem. I was so grateful that about half a month later they sent some people to cut all the trees twined by Semen Cuscutae. As such, a big ecosystem disaster is prevented in time. </p><p>And there are the U-bikes. Lots of advanced cities have public bike systems, such as Paris, Stockholm, New York, Washington, London, Hangzhou, Melbourne, Vienna and Taipei. The people could rent a bike at one station and give it back at another. It is usually free for the first hour, but afterwards it costs 3 dollars per hour in America, 1 euro in Paris, and 2 euros in Lyon. Because it is so cheap and convenient, U-bike becomes a common tool for transportation and exercise in Taipei. Seeing many people riding the bike on the street, you’ll feel that Taipei is an energetic and environmentally-friendly city.</p><p>Besides the stated examples, various speech and art activities provided by many professional institutions could be found everywhere and any time in the city to enrich our life. It’s so lucky to live in this clean, convenient, colorful and energetic great city. We should cherish what we have and make every effort to retain its beauty and liveliness. </p>
