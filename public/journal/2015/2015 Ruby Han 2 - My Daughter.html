<p><strong>May 21, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Daughter</em></strong></p><p>One night I met an old friend who told me that the reason he went to a computer class was to stop his children from teasing him. Many elderly people who couldn’t use emails, Facebook, Line or a smart phone are bound to become objects of mockery and scorn if they dare ask related questions. My case, however, is very different. </p><p>Though in my sixties, I can enjoy the convenience of using web searching, Word Processing, PowerPoint, and Line. All of the skills I need were taught by my daughter. When she found my computer was not functioning well, she insisted that I change it to a new one. She immediately saved all of my old files and magically assembled a complete PC for me together with her future husband. To organize and file all my essays that had been published many years ago in newspapers, in magazines and in book form, I decided to retype them. It was extremely discouraging, however, when I realized that I needed to type hundreds and thousands of Chinese characters with the Mandarin Phonetic Symbol System, which might take forever due to my slow typing speed. Surprisingly, my daughter offered to undertake this tedious, heavy task. And amazingly, she finished the mission I considered impossible right before her wedding.</p><p>My daughter always appears knowledgeable and experienced in handling daily matters. One time, my husband had had a small fever for two weeks. Though the doctors of the oncology department and gastroenterology all believed it was nothing serious, both of us felt it a worrisome problem but did not know what to do. My daughter then suggested we go to a hospital’s department of infectious diseases, where we should be able to solve the doubt over the fever with unknown cause.</p><p>Another time, I had visited as many lighting stores and furniture shops as possible to try to find a desk lamp but in vain. At last, I had no choice but to ask my daughter for advice. To my surprise, she answered readily: Both the E-life Mall Corporation and the Tsann Kuen Enterprise had on display the illuminations of various styles. I was extremely satisfied when I got to pick up a deep red desk lamp which was quite fashionable. </p><p>Since very young, my daughter has shown kindness and considerateness. Once, after a serious natural disaster, a lot of donation campaigns were going on everywhere in Taiwan. We parents didn’t know how much she had donated until she showed us an award from her school for her NT$200 donation to the victims. At that time, she was just a second grader. Now, she always brings home some food I like the best such as apple pies or tofu skin rolls, although I don’t eat them much for the sake of my health.</p><p>Most of us know a lot of “acquaintances” but have few “true friends.” My daughter’s golden heart and rare virtues, however, have won her valuable friendship everywhere, from elementary, junior and senior high schools, college to neighborhoods and workplaces. At the same time when I pay great admiration for her, I also feel lucky to have such a sweet and competent daughter. She is indeed a gift from God.</p>
