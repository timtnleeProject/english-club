<p><strong>Apr. 20, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>Stay in the Hospital</em></strong></p><p>On Feb. 2, I had a fever when I woke up in the morning. Afraid that it might get worse, I went at once to see a doctor at a clinic nearby. Two days later, my temperature did not drop at all, and so I went to another doctor who was good at reading X-rays at the Gen Xien Hospital. I was so glad that the doctor said I just got bronchitis. However, a 2-day antibiotic treatment did not work. On the third day I saw the doctor again. After a urine examination, he diagnosed my illness as urethritis. During the following five days, my temperature remained 37.5-38.5°C. There was no sign of getting better, so I had no choice but to go to the emergency room at the National Taiwan University Hospital on the night of Feb. 8.</p><p>	</p><p>Unexpectedly, seeing my chest X-ray, the doctor asked me to stay in the hospital as I had a serious pneumonia. There were a lot of shades around my lungs. Wondering if I had cancer, he arranged for me to have a lung puncture. I was startled when told to stay in the hospital for over 10 days.</p><p>On the first night, I stayed at the emergency room without even a chair for my family to sit on. Two patients sitting in the wheelchair on which to hang a drip feeding were stationed right before my bed for one hour, because there were no more beds left. I did not think it a good idea for me—who had a lung cancer history—to stay overnight in such a small space full of dirty air and crowded with patients. So I rushed my husband to go back home. Later after I returned to the hospital, I stayed alone every night except the second and third nights, when my sister and daughter kept me company. In the hospital, except taking medicine and having intravenous drips, I had all the time for myself. I finished reading the story of “Frozen” and some magazines. I did not get home until the Chinese New Year’s Eve, which fell on Feb. 18. </p><p>I figured that I must have caught the cold from my grandson Enn. Whenever a kid student gets sick with a fever over 37°C , the kindergarten would prohibit him from going to school. My daughter had no choice but to ask us to take care of him, because she needed to go to work and so did her husband. I did not think I could ever refuse to shelter the sick child Enn. Time after time, the situation repeats itself.</p><p>Now I know what I must do: First, I’ll wear a mask whenever the child gets sick and wash my hands all the time to keep from getting germs from him. Next, I’ll exercise for at least half an hour every day. If I keep good health, I wouldn’t be so vulnerable to bacterial infection. This is the self-help strategy I intend to implement. </p>
