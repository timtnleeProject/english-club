<p><strong>Apr. 24, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Bitter-Sweet Experience</em></strong></p><p>Pointing some kids’ pictures on the screen, I asked the fifty audience members, who worked at the clinics of different townships of Ilan County: “How are these kids under 15 related to breast cancer?” They looked at me with a confused but serious expression: “What is this lady going to talk about?” I smiled and explained: “There seems no relation between breast cancer and these kids, but the truth is breast cancer can cause huge damage to, or even take away the lives of, their beloved mothers.” Fifty nurses’ intense look told me that I successfully caught their attention, and their earnest attitude freed all my worries. In the following hour, I completely forgot that I was making a speech to a group of nurses.</p><p>Two months ago, the staff of an Ilan health clinic asked the chairman of our breast cancer alliance if we could give a speech on breast cancer for their nurses’ annual training on April 10. They had always invited doctors to be the speakers but this year, they wanted to make a change, so they asked us to help. When I knew that I was the one to do it, I thought to myself, “How can I teach nurses about breast cancer — something they must have known better than I?” Reluctantly, I took up the assignment, but I did not start preparation until two weeks before the speech conference.</p><p>Reading all the materials given by my boss, I got more confused because they were all doctors’ speeches. After thinking for a few days, I decided to prepare what these nurses needed instead of what I wanted to give them. Surfing on the Internet, I learned what these nurses’ duties were and what people would demand of them. Their most important duty was offering health information to people and encouraging them to have regular health checks. Finally I got a clue as to what to teach.</p><p>I spent a whole weekend finishing the PowerPoint file for presentation and writing down every word I had planned to say. After the speech, with a light touch on my shoulder from my boss as a gesture of encouragement, I began to believe that even though I was not a doctor or a nurse, I could make a good speech on breast cancer.</p><p>Sharing some patients’ cases made my speech more interesting. I made constant eye contact with my audience to make sure they were paying full attention. As a saying goes, “ten minutes’ performance takes 10 years’ practice.” Preparing this speech had almost driven me crazy; I had even cried a few times when I had had no clues about how to start and later how to continue. After the bitter but wonderful experience, I am convinced that if I keep learning and practicing, I may become an expert on breast cancer someday.</p>
