<p><strong>Apr. 28, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>Time to Refresh My Soul</em></strong></p><p> 	I'm a morning person. I get up early every morning. Rather than stay at home, I would go outside to enjoy swimming and walking or biking. I especially enjoy swimming. When my skin touches the water in the pool, it feels so great and comfortable. I can swim freestyle, breaststroke and backstroke. Under the water I can't hear or think, just relax. It feels like meditation which helps me achieve inner peace.</p><p>After swimming I usually take a walk by the riverside. There is fresh air and it smells so good that I always take a deep breath to inhale it all eagerly. There are also some fish swimming in the stream and different kinds of birds singing in the trees. If the weather is cooler I will go biking. I can ride slowly or fast as I wish. When the wind is blowing past my face I feel like a bird flying in the sky. It's fantastic. If it's on a rainy day, I will wear a raincoat and sing in the rain. It's so romantic. There are different scenes for different seasons, each being unique and beautiful.</p><p>         This is my routine activity that I think can refresh my soul. I really enjoy my morning time and I'm pleased with my life. I will keep it going for decades to come. You should do the same. Being a morning person will benefit you.</p>
