<p><strong>June 4, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Sweet Burden</em></strong></p><p>On Monday morning I went hiking instead of swimming. Climbing up to the mountain, with trees and birds’ singing surrounding me, I felt so relaxed but the feeling quickly disappeared when I thought of the heavy workload ahead: I had to prepare for six speeches to be given to new breast cancer patients in July, and I had to train volunteers to be the speakers. Gazing at the mountains in the distance, I asked myself, “What did I need to know most when I was receiving the cancer treatment14 years ago? How should I teach myself to go through chemotherapy?” Suddenly, I got a brilliant idea! If we treated those audiences as ourselves when we had first been diagnosed with breast cancer, the heavy burden would turn to be a sweet one.</p><p>	</p><p>However, before I got this idea, I was so afraid that I could not make it. Since I started working for the Breast Cancer Alliance, I have always felt greatly burdened right after taking charge of a big program. This one was different, because most things were out of my control—such as choosing which volunteer to be the speaker or the assistant. These volunteers might be good at sharing their experiences with new patients on the phone—like how to overcome chemotherapy’s side-effects and how to get useful information from their biological report, but making a speech was another story. I had to make the speeches easy for the volunteer speakers to understand and deliver.</p><p>	</p><p>To achieve my goal, I did not simply train the potential speakers to develop their oral skills but asked all volunteers to read reference books. My plan was to get them involved in this program by having them take up different roles in the project. To release their tension, I shared with them the idea I got during the morning walk: “When you stand on the stage, just think of all the audience as you who had been suffering and lost during the cancer treatment—in desperate need of guidance and support.” They all nodded with an agreeable smile. I felt warm and saw a gleam of hope.</p><p>I did appreciate those volunteers for spending precious time discussing the speech content with me. Without their full support, it was impossible for me to finish the PowerPoint for the first speech in two days. Now I no longer feel worried or burdened but enthusiastic and efficient because I know I am creating the greatest benefit for others, and that my friends are helping me. Though I still have a long way to go, I have faith in our power to accomplish the project to our satisfaction.</p>
