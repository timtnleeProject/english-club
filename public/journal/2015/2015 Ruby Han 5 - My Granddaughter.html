<p><strong>Dec. 31, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>My Granddaughter</em></strong></p><p>She is almost two years old now but still cannot speak any sentences. All she utters are simple words such as <em>hao (</em>好)<em>, yao (</em>要)<em>, ba-ba (</em>爸爸)<em>, ge-ge (</em>哥哥). When she comes to my place, she always points with her small finger at the cupboard asking for cookies, or at the refrigerator for grapes. She knows that her grandpa is good at machines, so she always hands him the remote control for him to find her children’s TV programs. Whenever I try to feed her to prevent her from dragging during eating, she will point her finger at her mouth, which shows that it is filled with food and that I should slow down and wait. Or, she will point to the bowl until I put it down, signaling that she refuses to be fed and wants to eat by herself. Of course, we have our moments of puzzle and struggle before we are able to figure out her system of sign language.</p><p>Monkey see, monkey do. Whatever her elder brother does, she will do the same. When he runs, she runs; when he crawls, she crawls. She will cough when he coughs. And when we eat with chopsticks, she will ask for a pair too. One time when she saw a Silkie (chicken with black skin, bones and flesh) walking toward her, she rushed to hide herself into her grandpa’s arms, holding him tightly and patting her chest while repeating the word<em> papa</em> (怕怕).</p><p>Unbelievably, she holds a pencil or chopsticks better than her five-year-old brother does. She is fully concentrated while painting or singing. We never know what she actually sings but we enjoy how she assumes the posture of a star singer whenever she grasps a microphone.</p><p>	</p><p>The little girl always does something unexpectedly amazing. One day, she wanted to watch some children’s TV programs, but the TV didn’t work. After her grandpa fixed the problem and showed her the program, the little girl said excitedly, “Yay!” And another time after I gave her as requested a piece of paper for drawing, she said, “<em>xie-xie</em>” (“Thank you” in Chinese).</p><p>	</p><p>Sometimes she can be quite strong-headed. She refuses to have her hair tied in braids; she insists to discard trash by herself; she always demands her mom to remove food residue from between her teeth before and after meals except when we threaten her to bring her to a dentist for an injection; she won’t let her grandpa hold her hand but loves to either tease him or hide from him, and she laughs out loud whenever she manages to escape from his attempted hugging.</p><p>	</p><p>In my place, she likes to follow me closely. When I cook in the kitchen, she will stand on a little stool behind me; when I go to the bathroom, she will wait for me quietly outside the door. She never leaves me alone for just a second. But what do you know? At the moment when her parents arrive to pick her up, she will instantly stride away with her head in the air. What a little ungrateful villain she is.</p><p>	</p><p>She is our pistachio. My home is always full of merriment and energy with her presence. I am so grateful that God has sent us this cute and innocent girl who brings us joy and makes us love her more each day. Time and tide wait for no one. The girl will grow up in no time. I know I must treasure this golden time of her childhood before it slips away in a blink of an eye.</p>
