<p><strong>Nov. 18, 2015</strong></p><p><strong><em>Where There Is a Will, There Is a Way</em></strong></p><p>Marie Sklodowska Curie was born in 1867 in Poland. When she was 24, she went to Paris to study. Three years later, she got master degrees in both physics and mathematics. At the age of 28, she married Pierre Curie, a young famous French scientist. At that time, some people found X-ray and U-ray — which had a strong penetrative power — but did not know where they came from exactly. </p><p>Marie was very interested in this unfamiliar field and was resolved to commit herself to it with a strong will. Her husband borrowed from the college an old laboratory which was completely empty except with a few desks and a blast furnace. There, it was extremely hot in the summer and freezing in the winter. When it rained, the roof would leak. They spent all of their small savings buying 20 kilograms of uraninite and other necessary equipment, filling the laboratory with containers of liquid and ore. Everyday Marie held an iron stick as long as her height to stir the boiling liquor in the big hot pot for many hours. During the experiment, they needed to be extremely cautious so as to keep the coal ashes and scrap irons from polluting the pure substance. They had lunch at the laboratory for fear of disrupting their experiment. Day after day, they worked as scientists, technicians and laborers. And at the end of each day when they unloaded their heavy work, they felt nearly passing out. With their effort, they finally found something to radiate beautiful soft light at one night in 1898.</p><p>As uraninite was extremely expensive, they had no choice but to reach out for help. Finally, the Austrian government agreed to provide them one ton of uranium. During the following four years, they used over seven tons of uraninite to get one gram of pure radium. At last, they made public the radium compound they extracted. As a result, they changed the world and saved one million wounded soldiers in WWI by using radium-ray to locate the bullet inside the injured body.</p><p>The couple had lived a simple life, dedicated to seeking the truth in life. In her wedding, Marie just wore a black dress instead of a white gown as a bride would wear conventionally. She simply thought it was less easy for a dress to get dirty at the laboratory.</p><p>In 1903, they did not go to Stockholm, Sweden, to receive the Nobel Prize award because of their work. One time when their friends looked in amazement at their daughter playing with a pure gold Davy Medal awarded by the British Royal Society of London commended to the couple for research on radium, Pierre responded, “I told her not to hold it too often, or else she might not accomplish anything in the future.” Surprisingly, Marie did not even have a formal dress to wear when going to Sweden to get her the second Nobel Prize in 1911, and the couple did not apply for any patents in their life. They just contribute their great achievements to the world with neither complaints nor regrets.</p><p>As our Chinese saying goes, “Such sublime state of mind may be hard to reach but we shall never cease yearning for it” (雖不能至，然心嚮往之). Marie and Pierre Curie are indeed the role model for all mankind to emulate.   </p>
