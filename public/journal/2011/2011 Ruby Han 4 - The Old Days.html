<p><strong>Sep. 14, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Old Days</em></strong></p><p>You can’t imagine how small the house we lived in the 1950s was: a dining table, used as a desk at the same time, and double-deck beds were crowded in one room. No TV, no air conditioner, no refrigerator, no toys; only several light-bulbs hung on the ceiling of the narrow, hot, dark house. After lunch or dinner, almost all kids in my neighborhood would rush out to the muddy road with tall grass on both sides to play with each other.</p><p>	</p><p>During daytime, we played hide and seek or jumped the rubber band; in the evening, we might catch the fireflies and put them in the little jar to gather the light, or we would sit outdoors listening to the stories told by adults. We always had the doors wide open for we were almost as close as family members.</p><p>	</p><p>My husband, Steve, was born on a little farm located in Shih Pai. Usually all children in the neighborhood would run after each other at the field or play the battle game by riding on another’s shoulders. One day, they wanted to play something different. Steve suggested they jump to the ground from the top of the barn. To prevent themselves from getting hurt, they pulled much hay grass from the big pile of straw and put them on the ground. All of them were very excited and happy except Steve. He got a severe penalty from his father for ruining the straw stack meant to be sold.</p><p>	</p><p>Living in Wai Shuang Xi, Steve learned how to swim in the river with a big banana trunk as a float. At night, after fastening a lamp to a tree to lure the shrimps, he would put a big net in the water where a lot of shrimps were gathering. Around an hour later, he would take out the net filled with numerous shrimps and go back home happily.</p><p>	</p><p>One day after school, as usual, Steve swam in the brook again with his elder brother. He was in the first grade then. Unfortunately, a poisonous snake took a bite on his back. It was so painful that he could hardly stand up, much less walking home. His brother had no choice but to carry him home on the back and then his father and brother immediately took him to the study center of poisonous snakes at Yuan Huan for an emergency treatment. Unexpectedly, the snobbish doctor just applied some ointment on his wound and refused to give his patient any medicine because they didn’t have enough money to pay. Helplessly, they left the center. Since Steve was so weak, they had to go home by a Pedicab. But unfortunately, the Pedi cab lost its balance and fell into the crop field on the side of the muddy road.</p><p>	</p><p>Naturally, Steve couldn’t go to school and just lay on the bed all day long with a painful swelling on his back and a stiff neck. Maybe god did show mercy on the poor: one of his relatives picked up some herbs from the mountain and his mother made him herbal sour every day. Gradually, he was getting well, after he had dropped out of school for one year. </p><p>	</p><p>Fortunately, however, nine children of this family have all stayed out of poverty now. The old days are gone, but the story of old becomes clearer and clearer in our mind each day. Maybe no trip of life is complete without such difficult and impressive experiences as Steve’s.</p>
