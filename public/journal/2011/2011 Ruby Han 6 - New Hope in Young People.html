<p><strong>Dec. 15, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>New Hope in Young People</em></strong></p><p>I always feared that the dentist may shop up my false tooth and make another one again because I had had over ten false teeth already. It not only cost me a fortune, but also made me suffer terribly. Fortunately, I found a senior dentist near my place, Dr. Wu, who was both skillful and virtuous. After he cured my toothache, he always just applied some medicine and told me to clean my teeth carefully every day. He never complicated the issue and thus won the great trust of my family members and my sister’s. As his loyal patients, we were all worried about what might happen if he should retire one day.</p><p>	</p><p>To our great shock, during the lunar New Year, Dr. Wu suddenly died of a heart disease. In addition to sadness, we were really anxious about who we should turn to when we had tooth problems.</p><p>	</p><p>Dr. Wu had a daughter who graduated from Taipei College of Medicine as her father did and later became a dentist at Wang Fang Hospital. Maybe because she was taking over the responsibility for her father’s patients, she re-opened her father’s clinic half a year later with new equipment and a team of Wang Fang Hospital doctors.</p><p>Even though all of these dentists are certified doctors, we all missed and better trusted the veteran one. My husband was the first among us to see one of the new and young dentists. With satisfaction, he showed his admiration for the one who treated him carefully and professionally and taught him how to clean the crack of his teeth with a small sharp brush. A few weeks later, I visited there reluctantly and skeptically. Before they cured me, they gave me an X-ray around all of my teeth and found one cavity on the right side. The doctor cleaned the cavity and filled it with some medicine. As to the false tooth, it was just a little inflamed. The entire treatment cost me only NT$100.</p><p>A few days after the dental treatment, my husband still felt uncomfortable and so went to the dentist again. Another young dentist there told him the pain was caused by the broken skin because he had brushed his teeth too hard. Soon, he got well after closely following the doctor’s instructions and brushing his teeth gently after meals. I can’t help but admit that the doctors of the new generation are better than the older ones in terms of either equipped devices or professional skill. </p><p>Believe it or not, on Oct. 22, I was forced to delay my Oct. 23 trip to Guei Lin by a young woman who was a leader of our travel group. She thought my Taiwan Compatriot Travel Certificate (MTP) would probably be refused by the immigration bureau at the Macao customs house because too many seals of various scenic spots were stamped on it although my MTP had been issued by the Hong Kong office. Neither the aged man who was responsible for my travel nor the Hong Kong civil officers had previously found out about this problem. I tried my best to persuade this young woman to let us go on our trip as scheduled, but she refused, insisting to protect the rights of the rest of the travel group members. It turned out that we were forced to delay our trip until I got a new MTP.</p><p>	</p><p>Although we didn’t go on our trip as scheduled, I still admired the young lady who with caution and principle insisted never to do anything illegal but to protect the best interest of the great majority. In fact, many excellent and responsible young people can be found on all walks of life. They have been making marvelous movies, designing innovative products, or inventing new ideas or devices to astonish the world again and again. They’re just awesome.   </p>
