<p><strong>May 2, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>Keeping in Fashion</em></strong></p><p>I used to be a sweater designer. I always wore something special to meet the expectation of myself and those who know me. At that time, I was too young to buy very expensive clothes. The only thing I could prove myself as a major in textile was to select natural fabrics and black color, because selection of natural fabrics relied on professional knowledge, and black was commonly acknowledged as a quality color in the fashion world. I also spent a lot of money on buying accessories when I traveled abroad, because I thought special accessories add attractiveness to regular clothing. </p><p>Later on, I set up a clothes design workshop. My wearing style was more formal than before because I often had business meetings with buyers that came from abroad. Most buyers placed orders to purchase from my company mainly for my taste in fashion. I remembered I once bought from a night market a big green check pattern bag that faked Ralph Lauren. One of my foreign buyers found the bag and told me I should not buy this kind of fake product because that would damage my company’s reputation. From then on I had always selected unknown brand products rather than pirate products of brand name.</p><p>For the next ten years, I had my own fashion boutique. I had a lot of clothes and I could put on whatever I liked in my boutique. But I always wore the clothes that nobody wanted to buy when they first arrived. In fact, the style of my clothing would become most popular and sell well.  </p><p>Now I am a housewife. I don’t need to wear any special style for anybody. Leisure and convenience are the most important things that I really care about. I always buy new clothing when there is a big sale. I prefer bright colors to black or gray. I think it’s quite different from what I used to like. And I always remind myself not to wear out of fashion, even if the clothing looks brand new. That is my way of keeping in touch with fashion.              </p>
