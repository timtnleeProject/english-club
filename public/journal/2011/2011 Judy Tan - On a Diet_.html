<p><strong>Dec. 2, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>On a Diet</em></strong></p><p>Everyone hopes to be on a diet except lean people and a piece of paper. I always dream that I could be thinner so I can wear medium size dresses. It’s really difficult to keep in good shape at my age. One of my acquaintances who used to wear medium size clothes now gets fat because she has stepped into her middle age life. I’m greatly afraid of losing control of my weight, so I decided to find a way to stop gaining it.</p><p>The standard way to reduce weight is to eat less and exercise more. People must count the calories of each intake and do exercises diligently. Never overeat and get lazy. Eat tofu, vegetables, and fruits instead of fried or sweet food. Quality is much more important than quantity. Eat as little as possible, and eventually you’ll get a slim body.</p><p>     </p><p>But why do I still stay in the same shape? People said one should eat breakfast  like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a beggar. This is too hard a principle for me to follow. I simply could not resist the temptation of delicious food, especially when I eat outside at a restaurant. Beefsteaks, creamed soup, spaghetti, pizza and cakes are all my favorites. Too much food and lack of exercise naturally lead to my failure to reach my goal. </p><p>A man nicknamed Bear succeeded in reducing 56 kilograms of his weight in one year. He controlled the calories he took in seriously and did exercises every day, whether it was shiny or rainy. It really touches me to know that he was jogging with an umbrella in the pouring nights. His ex-girlfriend cried for him when she found what great hardship he had suffered on a diet, and then she left him. Now, with the successful diet plan, he lives a happy life for he has found a new girlfriend and forgotten the pain of failure in love caused by his overweight one year ago. So, I tell myself: Never give it up; keeping slender can help one get happiness.  </p>
