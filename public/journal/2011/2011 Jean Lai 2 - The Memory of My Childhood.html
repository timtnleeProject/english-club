<p><strong>Dec. 16, 2011 </strong></p><p><strong><em>The Memory of My Childhood</em></strong></p><p>After reading the series of works about Growing Up and being asked “the way I played in childhood,” I started to recollect my childhood bit by bit.</p><p>We used to live in a daddy's bank dormitory. It was a Japanese style wooden house in Hawaii. There was a big courtyard where some fruit trees and a big old banyan with many long aerial roots had been planted, and a backyard with some vegetables grown there. Once in a while, we got some baby chicks and raised them. I remember I felt so excited and also scared of being pecked when I fed them by myself. The paradise-like vision has lasted even until now.</p><p> </p><p>Speaking of games, I played with my two older brothers at home most of the time. Sometimes I also played outdoor games with my friends such as hide-and-seek and jumping rubber bands. And my brothers played with each other in their own special way. But, here I’d rather mention more about the way I played with my brothers.</p><p>There were few toys in our childhood so we usually played games by using our imagination. One of us would play the role of a shopkeeper and the other two, customers. We would kneel down on the tatami, a kind of Japanese style mattress, and put stuff among us, pretending to select merchandise, to inquire about prices, to bargain, to pay, or to give small changes. We took some papers and wrote down numbers to fake dollar bills and used buttons of different shapes to stand for coins of different value. Sometimes, when there was nothing offhand, we would have our thumb and pointed fingers overlap each other as if holding a bill, and our palms clasped together to form a shape of funnel as if holding given changes. The great fun of the game lies in the dialogues we made up. Maybe that was how we began to know how to bargain and negotiate.</p><p>Besides, we once put a cane chair down and had one of us lie in it, acting like a customer who had his hair cut and washed in a barbershop. Unexpectedly, we found some patterns on the chair which were formed by interlacing different colors of the rattan, and then we began to discuss them. To our surprise, even if everyone had a very different idea about the same pattern, each of our opinions made sense. That was also the first time for us to know how unlimited imagination could be.</p><p>Although there were not so many toys when we were little and the way we played was extremely simple, the unbreakable relationship between my brothers and me had been enhanced bit by bit through one after another game.</p>
