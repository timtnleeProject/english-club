<p><strong>May 30, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Terrible Sky Lanterns</em></strong></p><p>On Feb. 13, the Lantern Festival of 2006, a sky lantern fell at the Taoyuan Airport runway and caused a big fire. Because of the big wind, the fire got out of control, although 16 fire engines soon arrived at the spot. At the end, the grass on the runway was burnt out thoroughly, the airport was forced to close down for 32 minutes, and 18 flights were either delayed or canceled.</p><p>On the same day, a car carrying six young people suddenly flipped at a 90 degrees angle because something blocked the windshield of their car on the Second Northern Freeway near Chu-nan. To their surprise, the “something” turned out to be a damaged big red sky lantern.</p><p>	</p><p>March 17, 2010, another sky lantern with many blessing words written on it and the names of the Lions signed on it suddenly hit the windshield of Miss Cheng’s car on the freeway. Scared, Cheng couldn’t see anything ahead of her. Fortunately, she checked the rear view mirror to drive slowly to the road shoulder without getting hurt.</p><p>	</p><p>Almost 10 years ago, the mountain in I-lan caught on fire due to a fallen sky lantern. Ironically, the sky lanterns intended to seek blessings and good fortune caused a wide range of disasters all the time. Environmental protector Lin Ming-de (林明德), who named himself Taiwan’s Forrest Gump, had ever picked up on the mountain a sky lantern with the words “falling in love” and the names of the love couple written on it. Lin questioned the meaning of releasing a sky lantern since the outcome of such a tradition had violated its originally good intention. Setting off the lanterns not only easily caused fire but also wasted the resource in forestry. Worst of all, the lanterns would pollute the environment when they eventually fell on the ground.</p><p>	</p><p>Mr. Lin calls for an inhibition of such a practice. Or at least, if you have to release a sky lantern, you must tie a long thread to it so as to pull it back in the same way you fly a kite, to avoid causing any fire or danger. The problem is some people do take precaution, but most people don’t. The activity of sky lanterns becomes more and more popular, and the time of its celebration becomes longer and longer year after year. What a serious problem we are facing now.</p><p>Taiwanese people strongly oppose the development of the petrochemical industry for the environmental pollution it has caused in Zhang Hwa and furiously reject the building of power plants. But if you look around, you see how people would also insist the authorities of some public areas to have the indoor air conditioned to below 26∘C, even if it means they might have to wear heavier clothes in hot summer days. People use and then throw away plastic bags, plastic containers, and disposable chopsticks. That is, people casually pollute or ruin their living environment and willfully waste the limited resources. And worst of all, these people make harsh demands on others but never reflect on and regulate themselves by the same principles, if they have any.</p>
