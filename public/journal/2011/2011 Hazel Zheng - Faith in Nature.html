<p><strong>June 3, 2011</strong></p><p><strong><em>Faith in Nature</em></strong></p><p>I was born in a small fishing village where people were poor but simple and sincere. A picture has long been imprinted in my memory—a magnificent traditional house where records were stories of a big family’s sorrow, joy and growth. In such stories, a courtyard could attract a group of innocent kids to spend leisure hours tossing cans or playing hide and seek games. When they were running, laughing and sweating there, the sunshine turned their cheeks red. The scene of kids’ laughing had drawn the sun to immerse itself in the delightful mood. It seemed so eager to join them that it had almost forgotten to spread the twilight on the earth. What a wonderful courtyard!</p><p>Unlike most kids in my neighborhood, I seldom enjoyed courtyard time. Therefore, for a long time a seed of envy had sprouted stealthily and firmly in the depth of my mind. Together with my siblings, I needed to help our parents do the routine work either in the house or on the farm. Cutting weeds on fields occupied all our time after school. I murmured frequently, “Weeds, weeds, why couldn’t you just disappear for good?” My father always responded by saying, “No pain, no gain. Stop complaining; just keep working.” Father had relied on a huge farmland to make a living, to raise us kids, but a huge land also means endless work of farming and meager courtyard time. It was a burden to me. I hated it once.</p><p>The huge field also gave me a feeling of fear which greatly affected a child’s mentality. “There was a hearsay that the ghosts lived in the trees,” more than one of my neighbors would say the same thing with a horrified expression. And then a thrill excited by my imagination would follow me on my way to school: While walking alone on the three-kilometer-long tranquil road, I heard the wind roaring, the frogs croaking, and the dogs barking, before sacredness occupied my mind. It was as if the ghosts and I were the only ones that remained in the whole universe. For the first time, the journey was so long and difficult that it was like a punishment. The terrible experience made me refuse to go to school. My mother asked why I was so lazy. I didn’t tell her the truth. “What a ridiculous idea,” she would have said. She didn’t know the first thing about the supernatural world, and so she wouldn’t understand the impact the event had had on me. As time went by, I was pushed to overcome the fear of being alone. Now, I’ve got used to getting along with loneliness. I can enjoy the fun and freedom of being alone by the seashore, up in the mountains, or on the farmland, more than I do among the noisy crowd or in places haunted by gossip. When I feel down, I’ll go into nature to release my bad emotions. I’ll cry, think or meditate, and then feel that an amazing power cures my wounded soul and keeps me warm. That is why as I grow older I become a nature lover.</p><p>	</p><p>I can’t explain why I pursue a natural life so enthusiastically. I do believe, however, that organic foods and a life of sustainability are essential to the preservation of health since most of today’s produce, edible or inedible, are more or less poisonous, or unnecessarily artificial. I try to find quality produce for my family and persuade them to accept it. I see it as my duty. “The idea is so stupid. How do you know the goods are really organic?” Some of my friends and relatives would ask suspiciously. Nevertheless, I have continued sharing organic products and related information with them and promoting the value of organic foods. Although even my husband at first didn’t support it, I still insisted on cooking meals with organic ingredients. I think the master of a kitchen should wisely take care of not only the look and taste of the food but also its nutrition and healthiness. I am sure organisms can help fulfill the goal.</p><p>	</p><p>A question emerges and bothers me frequently: What would I be like at old age? Most people avoid discussing death but I talk to my friends about it, trying to face it positively and deal with it presently. My major concern is how people at old age maintain their dignity. When I saw a group of elders sitting on wheel chairs with no facial expressions, no energy, and no hope, but only the unconcerned caretakers accompanying them, I exclaimed, “How pitiable they are!” I don’t want such a lifestyle of old age. I realize that even people with better education or of higher social status such as doctors, professors, or engineers, may also neglect their elderly family. “This is an inevitable situation in an advanced society,” people say. Those cases give me a lesson that we have to save ourselves in the best way, preparing for the years to come. And so, keeping ourselves from depression and unhappiness is very important in old age. Facing the unpredictability of life, I choose to lay my hope in returning to nature.</p><p>Consequently, a dream land was pictured in my mind. In 2004 I made a decision to carry out my plan of buying farmland and following my father’s step to become a farmer. I had thought it over carefully, holding the belief that I could make it work if I had the strength and endurance of my father, who could stand extremely hard farming which had occupied his whole life. He lived up to his motto, “No pain, no gain,” and passed the test given by the Creator: he complained little but felt complete satisfaction. But could I reach my goal? I asked myself again and again. </p><p>No matter what, I’m prepared to learn my lesson and accept challenges. In the autumn of 2009, I finally owned my dream land. It is located in Hsin-chu. When I intended to look for a farm—a virgin land unpolluted by pesticide, I had no idea how to start. Obviously it’s not easy. Fortunately I never naively deemed it an easy job. My husband and I sought all possibilities from signboards on the roadside and from the brokers. In five years, we had searched over 100 places. None of them were to my liking. My husband said that I was too particular: nothing but the best will do! He once felt frustrated and tried to abandon the project, but I always kept the dream going. I firmly believed that as long as I didn’t give up easily, the dream would come true someday.</p><p>I prefer Hsin-chu because it is convenient to visit my parents from there. In 2009, the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December was a big day—to sign the contract of purchasing the land of my dreams. I deeply appreciate my husband for accompanying me to drive between Taipei and Miao-li countless times. My younger brother has retired himself as a colonel to become a wonderful farmer who now manages the farmland by using permanent agriculture, a kind of natural farming which produces a maximum effect that is said to fix the entire world’s problems in a garden. I would also like to show my great appreciation for my father, whose example has affected me so far and so deeply that I have no fear but only faith in nature.</p><p>Life is so amazing. As I was young, I was not fond of farmland. Now I’m in my middle age, and I’ve made a vow to be a life-long nature lover. When my dreams finally came true, I prayed to God for eternal blessing. I am grateful, for being able to figure out the aim for my future life of old age and restore my precious gift of appreciating nature, trusting it, as well as living in it.</p>
