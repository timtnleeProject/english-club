<p><strong>Apr. 13, 2011 </strong></p><p><strong><em>Mission Impossible</em></strong></p><p>One month before my daughter’s 17<sup>th</sup> birthday, I began to ponder what kind of gift I wanted to give her. It’s a little hard to find proper stuff for children who don’t seem to lack anything nowadays.</p><p>An idea flashed through my mind after I visited an exhibition of knitting. There were many beautiful works with varied styles and colors, and all were delicate. That inspired me to pick up again my knitting needle, which I had put away for nearly 20 years. Maybe I could knit a sweater for my little girl by myself. That would make a wonderful and significant present, I thought.</p><p>I went to a yarn store my mom’s friends recommended to me. I had been told that there were lots of books for customers to consult and make copies from, and the clerks of the store provided help if needed. I told the owner, who was a lady just about my age, about my wish that I wanted to knit a sweater. She flatly refused,“You can’t start with such an ambitious work after having stopped knitting for so long. You’d better start from a small piece.” I took her advice, although I thought I was competent. I finished a wool cap in one day, and went back to choose the pattern and material for the sweater knitting. But the storekeeper said again, “You must start with a vest instead of a sweater.” I followed her advice again, although I had knitted several of them before.</p><p>She asked me to knit a 10 cm by 10 cm piece first to see how the density was in order to have a layout. That was necessary, of course, I knew. I wanted everything to be the best so I relied on her professional guidance for me to make for my daughter a perfect birthday present; or else, I could have done it all on my own.</p><p>I went back the next day to show her my little piece and discuss the design that I printed from the web. She suggested I use a round instead of a pointed collar, but that was not what I wanted. I insisted this time. I understood that she worried she couldn’t afford the time to resolve the problems I might face in completing the difficult knitting project, but I still chose to believe in myself. We finally reached a consensus when I promised not to trouble her again later.</p><p>I left the little piece there and was told to get the layout four days later. Oh my God, there were only two weeks left after I went back and forth between home and the store, and she still wanted me to wait for another four days. Didn’t she know how limited my time was and how much could have been done during the four days? There was no choice for me but to finish it in 14 days. So, I still left the little piece there to be designed as scheduled, but I began to do what I thought proper. </p><p>I figured that if I knitted 10 cm long a day, it would be done at the same rate. So, I worked hard and secretly, in the day and after my daughter got into bed. I got the layout on time and altered it a little to make it closer to my ideal without violating her design logic. I did the same thing day after day. Finally, the critical moment came. When my daughter cut a caper to show how happy she was to receive the sweater I made for her, I was fully content. </p>
