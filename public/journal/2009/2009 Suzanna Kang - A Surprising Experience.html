<p><strong>May 7, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Surprising Experience</em></strong></p><p>My friend intended to introduce a young man to my son’s teacher two years ago, and so together we arranged a dinner appointment in a Japanese restaurant. Before the day, the young man abruptly asked us though my friend how we would get there and if we would give him a ride, because his car was under repair in a garage. Such a rude request! Of course we said “No.”</p><p>	</p><p>When we got there that day, the young man had arrived by bus, sitting there and looking like a gentleman. And so it was really surprising later when he said he had 45 credit cards and took six cell phones out of his suitcase. He told us he could get some gifts from each bank when using credit cards for the first time, and his cell phones were used separately to call different persons and institutes. Both my son’s teachers were really astonished. The young man continued to say that he always looked for abandoned cars on the roadside so that he could earn extra 500 bucks for each car after he reported it to the authorities. With our eyes staring wide open, my son’s teacher and I could not believe what we had heard and were greatly puzzled by the man sitting in front of us, who was all ridiculous and unpleasant.</p><p>	</p><p>Further annoyingly, it was not he but his aunt who paid the bill for the meal. The set dinner cost only NT$180 per person, but he was stingy enough not to stand the treat. It’s a big question how a man like this one would ever get himself a girlfriend.</p>
