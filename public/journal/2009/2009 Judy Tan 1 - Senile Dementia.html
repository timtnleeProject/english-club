<p><strong>Mar. 17, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>Senile Dementia</em></strong></p><p>Nothing can be more terrible than for us to lose our memory. Just imagine someday we could no longer remember what we have done, where our home is, and even whom we have loved. It’s sad that people are bound to change their role from a helper to one that is being helped. It seems natural that we will get older day by day, but senile dementia is simply too cruel a fact to accept and face. </p><p>The elder’s forgetfulness, incontinence, confusion of time and space, and all other unpredictable situations test the patience of those who look after them. Senile dementia will only get worse with time. The elderly become gradually disabled, and taking care of them is one of the hardest jobs.</p><p>Take for example one of my friends Ling, whose mother suffered senile dementia. Her father and a servant had taken care of her mother for many years. It was sad that her father passed away last year and left her deceased mother alone in the world. I just could not believe what I heard! It must have been the heavy pressure that had crushed her father finally. There are so many examples just like the case of my friend’s father.</p><p>The senile who suffer dementia used to be doctors, lawyers or any other outstanding professionals, but under the tyranny of time, they have lost not only memory, but their social position, interpersonal relationships, and their ability to seek a livelihood. Everything they have is gone!</p>
