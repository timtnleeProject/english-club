<p><strong>Mar. 31, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>Silly Girls</em></strong></p><p>Recently I’ve heard the news that an unemployed young lady had sex in one month with four boys she met online. Finally she got pregnant and gave birth to a baby and of course none of the four men acknowledged being the father of the baby. Now she must send her baby away because it was too heavy a burden for her to raise the child all by herself. My goodness, was she an idiot or something?</p><p>	</p><p>A daughter of one of my friends made up her mind to get married right after graduation from high school. No matter how her parents advised her not to do such a stupid thing, she got married with a baby after she got pregnant. The couple quarreled a lot over their embarrassing living. Six years later, she could no longer endure such a low quality marriage, and so she asked for a divorce and went back to her parents’ to stay. Her husband, after getting drunk, threatened to hurt her family members. She felt she had no choice but to go back to her husband again. How silly the young girl was! And how dear a price it was for the wrong choice she had unwisely made!</p><p>	</p><p>One other news reported on a young lady of a rich family in Mainland China who tried to poison herself to death because she was not satisfied with her look. Fortunately, she was rescued in time by her relatives. I just couldn’t understand why anyone would do such an unbelievable thing. What’s wrong with our family, our school education, and our society?</p>
