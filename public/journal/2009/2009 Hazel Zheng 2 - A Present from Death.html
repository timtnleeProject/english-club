<p><strong>Nov. 12, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Present from Death</em></strong></p><p>One of my friends, Bau-yen, passed away five years ago. When she was alive, she told me a mystery story about her negotiation with Death. It was late autumn when there was too much rain. The day was drizzly. The chilliness in the air-conditioned ward made her shiver. Since the doctor informed her that she needed to undergo a major operation, she was overwhelmed by an inexpressible pathetic emotion. “Why me? Ever since then, I have no longer been able to sleep well,” she said sadly.</p><p>	</p><p>I knew that she must have been anxious about the safety of the surgery. “What if my decision was wrong? My son is so little that he needs to be taken care of thoroughly,” she said in tears. “The fear has followed me all along, even after I entered the operation room. Before the nurse was pushing the sickbed into the anesthetic room, I struggled in my mind about whether to put off the surgery, thinking perhaps it was a mistaken diagnosis,” she said nervously. “Then, all apprehension and wild imagination was forced to stop when I was undergoing general anesthesia for the operation. ‘Now, you could get a good sleep,’ the nurse said. Outside, my folks waited, and inside, I had to confront Death.</p><p>	</p><p>“If I told you how marvelous it was, you must be doubtful,” she said. “A strong light stabbed my eyes to make me wink and I could hardly open my eyes. Then a strange man pulled my hand, stared at me, and said, ‘Come with me. I would bring you to another world where you could get rid of pain forever.’ I was astonished and gave no response. Suddenly he yelled out my name to rush me. ‘It is time to go,’ he said. ‘No,’ I shouted back, understanding what might be happening, but he was irritated by me. He grabbed my hand so tightly that I couldn’t pull away.</p><p>	</p><p>“ ‘I am Death. I am Death,’ his voice was so very loud that it shocked me. I put on good manners to entreat him to show mercy, ‘I have a little child, just three years old. Please let me go back to my world.’ He insisted on his command. Then I wept bitterly, groveled at his feet and asked, ‘If you were a mother, what would you do?’ I made a promise that when my son gets to be twenty years old, he could take me away. He closed his eyes and bunched his eyebrows. After a few seconds’ silence, his look turned friendlier. “Here, I have a present for you, but it is also a deal made between us,’ he said. ‘I’ll let you go back to the world of mortals but . . . .’ Then, I felt a streak of warm air flowing through my hands, and I heard a sweet voice echoing ‘Mommy! Mommy!’ My husband and son were squeezing me.” </p><p>	</p><p>Soon, her son, Ka-bian, grew to be a tall, handsome and intelligent young man, attending National Tsing Hua University and majoring in electrical engineering. One morning, she had a terrible bellyache and was sent to the hospital. “You must be hospitalized immediately,” the doctor said seriously. “Cancer! I know finally you are coming,” she said peacefully. One year later, my friend passed away. Her son was twenty years old. I don’t know if Ka-bian knew about this story. But I do know how much effort his mother had made to get the priceless present from Death.</p>
