<p><strong>May 1, 2009</strong></p><p><strong><em>A Letter to My Daughter</em></strong></p><p>Dear Christee,</p><p>That day, you told me with sad eyes that you were almost to give up the school work, for you didn’t think studying hard would help your entrance examination; you were so frustrated by the fact of not moving any step further no matter how hard you tried. You complained: “Why do some people make a hit so easily? Why didn’t God give me the gift that I need?” You seemed to have suffered grievous pain for not being talented or smart enough.</p><p>	</p><p>Several times, there are so many things that I want to tell you before you grow up, but I don’t know how.  You are always busy and silent. And so I am writing this letter, to be later folded and put inside your book, in the hope that you may read it and be comforted.</p><p>My dear, I must tell you, God is indeed fair to everyone. He surely gives a gift to everybody, but he won’t tell what it is, or when it will come, and so you must find it by yourself. Some are fast, some are slow, some are upset for waiting so long, and some are angry or sorry for being treated unequally. You haven’t discovered it so far, but it doesn’t mean that you won’t have it in your life. Maybe, you will get it when you are 20 years old or 50 years old. Some gifts are so rare and special that they require great efforts to identify. Some gifts are hidden somewhere along the path to success, which is certainly not based on how large a fortune or power you have. I too had once thought I had no gift, but soon I learned that it was when I was lost in big confusion and stuck in deep mud that I became clearly aware of the gift he did bestow upon me. I can only rely on myself to find the truth about me. And I’m sure God has granted you gifts, which you will be able to recognize and define precisely only after you fully know yourself. </p><p>To my understanding, you are not treated unfairly. You have full limbs with a pretty face. You are honest with a pure mind, sympathetic with a just heart, generous with cordiality and friendliness. Besides, you have much more courage than any other girls I have known. All these virtues will give you more power to stop fears from corroding you deep inside. Compared with some unlucky persons, you are blessed to have come to the world with enviable fortune. You have little to complain about really. Whatever circumstances you face, you should trust yourself to try your very best and fully develop your potential. Whenever you feel exhausted, you should keep in mind the old virtues I kept nagging you to practice as a major resource of life-long support. One day you will see the most precious gift God has granted is the strength to resolve a dilemma or overcome a hardship on your own. So do not ever lose your faith.</p><p>You have displayed potential in leadership among those of your age, but try to have an open mind to broaden your vision by making friends with those from different cultures. Don’t just isolate yourself in one small group. Serving others is a key to becoming mature for you may learn from tasks and chores that will help construct a strong foundation for your future life. Besides, you must have a strong constitution. Now you look weak and short of energy. How could you deal with the ongoing trials and tests without a healthy body and a sound mind? Please, walk outside to have the sun shine on you and keep yourself physically fit. Although nobody is certain of tomorrow, we can all determine to be strong, be confident, and be happy. Don’t surrender the dream you have, just like I never give up on you. Someday you will walk with pride when you taste the splendid fruit. And you will know that the greatest hero in the world is yourself. </p><p>Wish you all the best.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Your mom</p>
