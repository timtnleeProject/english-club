<p><strong>Oct. 19, 2012 </strong></p><p><strong><em>Summary of the Movie “Chun’s Photo Album”</em></strong></p><p>Sitting in the flight from Tokyo to Bangkok, Xiao casually browsed through the newspaper. A headline “Government to Build a Reservoir at Haw-Gu Village in De-Dou (德島) County” caught Xiao’s eyes and brought him back to three years ago.</p><p>	</p><p>At that time, Xiao took two jobs at the same time to make a living: a photographer’s assistant and a cleaner. One midnight after he finished his work, Xiao went back to his small apartment. When he turned on the answering machine, he heard a message from one of his good friends from his hometown, Haw-Gu Village. “It’s me. Please give me a call. Your father needs your help to take pictures of the village people.” After checking with his friend, Xiao unwillingly packed up and hurried back to Haw-Gu Village.</p><p>	</p><p>Xiao’s father, Takahashi, had volunteered to take pictures of his adorable neighbors and their lovely homes or workplaces before they would move away from the government’s plan to build a reservoir at their hometown, Haw-Gu Village. Xiao’s friend, however, did not think Takahashi, who had a severe lung cancer, could bear such a heavy burden, so he secretly asked Xiao to come back to help. </p><p>	</p><p>Xiao had had a very bad relationship with his father and found it impossible to work with the stubborn old man. Little did he know that his father felt deeply proud of him because the son had fulfilled the father’s dream. While young, Takahashi had worked in Tokyo but gave it up because of his wife’s health condition.</p><p>	</p><p>For the project at hand, Takahashi insisted on going to every neighbor’s home on foot and while he took pictures, he always put a big smile on his face and patiently waited for the residents to show their most natural and beautiful facial expressions. Every time after taking pictures, he would bow to thank them. And he rarely rested except when enjoying lunch boxes made by Xiao’s younger sister. Xiao could not understand such patience, such humbleness and such seriousness. Still unwillingly, he followed his father’s step to climb one after another mountain. Finally they reached Grandma Shan-Ben’s home. She was sitting in her Japanese-style room. Knowing they would take pictures of her, she struggled to climb into bed to get her son’s and husband’s pictures. She put the two photos on her hands respectively and asked Takahashi to take a picture of “her whole family.” Gratefully she pointed at the persimmon tree and said to Takahashi, “Please come back when my persimmons turn red; I will treat you some.”</p><p>After several days’ hard work, Takahashi finally succumbed to his disease and was hospitalized before taking pictures of the one last group of neighbors, the lumbermen. One day, his ward was opened, to his great surprise, by Grandma Shan-Ben, who was pushing a wheelchair with a pile of red persimmons on it. She came all the way from the remote mountain all alone to fulfill her promise. Takahashi tasted one of them with dim eyes and a delighted smile. </p><p>	</p><p>At his father’s request, Xiao went to the forest to take pictures of those lumbermen. He took lots of pictures but all of them turned dull, unlike his father’s works, in which everyone was smiling and showed great energy. He finally understood that without humbleness, he could not shoot a good picture despite his great skills. He begged his father to finish the last picture together with him because he could not make it by himself. Finally, both of them climbed up the mountain again. This time, Xiao followed his father closely.</p><p>	</p><p>Walking on the mountain road covered with fallen leaves, they heard only birds’ singing as well as Takahashi’s breathless panting. The panting got more serious when they walked uphill. Finally he could no longer move his step and so Xiao carried his father on his back all the way to the logging hut. It had been an incredibly long time since they last got so close to each other. Xiao realized that it was his responsibility as a son to help finish the last photos.</p><p>	</p><p>Their footsteps became lighter on the way home. When they got to some flat hill, Xiao took a final glimpse at each household he and his father had visited, and suddenly realized why his father insisted on walking to every neighbor’s home. Such a long walk helped Xiao understand the environment of the neighborhood, and it helped all residents feel the sincere hearts of photographers.</p><p>Three years later, the government did build a reservoir as planned. Xiao thought to himself while reading the newspaper. Slowly moving his eyesight to the window, he smiled and felt grateful to have had such a wonderful working experience with his father.</p>
