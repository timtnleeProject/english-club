<p><strong>Feb. 24, 2024</strong></p><p><strong><em>Dental Care for the Senior</em></strong></p><p>There is an old saying that if elders have firm teeth, it might reduce the blessings for their children and grandchildren. My children needn't worry because their mother has had dental issues.</p><p> </p><p>I have experienced tooth decay, gum inflammation, root canal treatments, dental crown installations, teeth extractions, dental bridge replacements, and implant surgeries. It seems I have not taken good care of my oral hygiene, despite making great efforts since I was young. Perhaps I have done something wrong, but I highly suspect it is related to genetics. Among my three sisters, one's original teeth are in perfect condition at 70—similar to our father—while the others, including myself, have suffered serious teeth problems for many years, similar to our mother. The two of us always try much harder to maintain our oral hygiene than the majority.</p><p>Let's review several essential tips for elderly dental care that should be part of everyday hygiene routines:</p><p><strong>Tip 1. Brushing</strong></p><ul><li>Brush teeth twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed, and brush thoroughly for a minimum of 2 minutes.</li><li>Some experts suggest brushing after every meal for 3-5 minutes.</li><li>Certain dentists mention that they do not brush teeth immediately after eating to let saliva neutralize pH first and protect tooth enamel.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip 2. Flossing</strong></p><ul><li>Floss regularly to reduce the risk of cavities and gum disease. Flossing is as important as brushing, and the benefits far outweigh any perceived inconvenience.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip 3. Regular Dental Visits</strong></p><ul><li>Visit the dentist twice yearly for teeth cleaning and examinations to catch any problems early. Never wait until a toothache occurs.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip 4. Hydration</strong></p><ul><li>Drink more water, especially after every meal, to help wash out the negative effects of sticky and acidic foods and beverages.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip 5. Healthy Eating</strong></p><ul><li>Eating crunchy fruits and vegetables not only provides healthy fiber but also exercises your jaws.</li></ul><p><strong>Tip 6. Limiting Sugary and Acidic Foods</strong></p><ul><li>Sugar converts into acid, which can erode tooth enamel, as can acidic fruits.</li></ul><p>As we age, dental care is crucial for maintaining our overall quality of life.</p>
